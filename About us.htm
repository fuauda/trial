BICAP Recap website is designed to help high school 
students to recap key points in different subjects. A recap allows 
students to revisit key concepts and information covered in the subject, reinforcing 
their understanding and retention of the material.  A recap provides an opportunity for 
students to ask questions and seek clarification on any topic they may have found confusing or challenging. 
A recap also helps students review thier knowledge before exams, insuring they are well prepared to demonistrate 
their understanding of the material. Overall, a subject recap plays a crucial role in enhancing student learning 
outcomes and overall academic performance.<br>
To reinforce learning, clarify doubts, prepare for exams, reflection and self assessiment, we will keep on uploading recap of other subjects such as chemistry, physics, astronomy and IT.

6.1 <u>Ecology</u><br><br>


6.1.1 <u>Definitions</u><br><br>


Every day you share your environment with many organisms. These
can be as small as houseflies or mosquitoes. They can be dust mites
that you cannot even see. Larger animals include dogs, cows, and
hyenas. You need to know about your environment. The reason is
simple: your environment affects you and every other organism in
it. The study of plants and animals, where they live, what they eat,
and what eats them, is called natural history. Natural history tells us
about the health of the world we live in.<br><br>


What is Ecology?<br>

The branch of biology that developed from natural history is known
as ecology. Ecology is the study of relationships of organisms to one
another and to their environment. The scientist who studies ecology
is known as ecologist.<br>


Ecologists use both qualitative and quantitative research. They
gather qualitative information by observing organisms and their
environment. They gather quantitative data by making measurements
and doing experiments. Ecologists study organisms both in the
laboratory and in the field where they live.<br>



6.1.2. <u>Biotic and abiotic components</u><br><br>



Abiotic Factors<br>






Abiotic factors are non-living components of the ecosystem that
influence the distributions of organisms in their environment.
Examples of abiotic factors include: energy, light, temperature, water,
nutrients, salinity, etc.<br>


Energy: All organisms require a usable source of energy to live. Solar
energy from sunlight, captured by chlorophyll during the process of
photosynthesis, powers most ecosystems. Lack of sunlight is rarely the
most important factor limiting plant growth for terrestrial ecosystems,
although shading by trees does create intense competition for light
among plants growing on forest floors. In many aquatic environments,
however, light cannot penetrate beyond certain depths. As a result,
most photosynthesis in a body of water occurs near the surface.
Surprisingly, life also thrives in environments that are completely
dark. These ecosystems are powered by bacteria that derive energy
from the oxidation of inorganic chemicals such as hydrogen sulfide.
Bacteria with similar metabolic talents support communities of caved
dwelling organisms.<br>


Temperature is an important abiotic factor because of its effect
on metabolism. Few organisms can maintain a sufficiently active
metabolism at temperatures close to 0°C (32°F), and temperatures
above 45°C (113°F) destroy the enzymes of most organisms (Fig.6.1).
Most organisms function best within a specific range of environmental
temperatures.<br>




Water is essential to all life. Aquatic organisms are surrounded by
water, but they face problems of water balance if their own solute
concentration does not match that of their surroundings. For
terrestrial organisms, the primary threat is drying out in the air. Many
land animals have watertight coverings that reduce water loss, such as reptilian scales. Most plants have waxy coatings on their leaves and
other aerial parts.<br>


The distribution and abundance of photosynthetic organisms,
including plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria, depend on the
availability of inorganic nutrients such as compounds of nitrogen
and phosphorus. Plants obtain these nutrients from the soil. Soil
structure, pH, and nutrient content often play major roles in
determining the distribution of plants. In many aquatic ecosystems,
low levels of nitrogen and phosphorus limit the growth of algae and
photosynthetic bacteria.<br>


Several abiotic factors are important in aquatic, but not terrestrial,
ecosystems. While terrestrial organisms have a plentiful supply of
oxygen from the air, aquatic organisms must depend on oxygen
dissolved in water. This is a critical factor for many species of fish.
Cold, fast-moving water has higher oxygen content than warm or
stagnant water. Salinity (saltiness), currents, and tides also play a
role in many aquatic ecosystems.<br>


Some abiotic factors affect terrestrial, but not aquatic, ecosystems. For
example, wind is often an important factor on land. Wind increases
an organism’s rate of water loss by evaporation. The resulting increase
in evaporative cooling can be advantageous on a hot summer day, but
it can cause dangerous wind chill in the winter. In some ecosystems,
frequent occurrences of natural disturbances such as storms or fire
play a role in the distribution of organisms.<br><br>


Biotic Factors<br>


Biotic factors are the living components of the ecosystem that influence
the distributions of organisms in their environment. Often, the ability
of a species to survive and reproduce is reduced by its interactions
with other species, such as predators (organisms that kill their prey)
or herbivores (organisms that eat plants or algae). Herbivores could
affect the distribution of a food species. In addition to predation and
herbivory, the presence or absence of pollinators, food resources,
parasites, pathogens, and competing organisms can act as a biotic
limitation on species distribution. Such biotic limitations are common
in nature.<br>
<img src="img62.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
<br>


6.1.3. <u>Ecological levels</u><br><br>


Ecologists study individual organisms. They study relationships among
organisms of the same species and connections among organisms
of different species. They also study the effects of abiotic factors on
species that live together. To make it easier to examine all of these
biotic and abiotic interactions, ecologists have organized the living
world into levels. The levels are the organism by itself, populations, communities, ecosystems and biosphere. The traditional
ecological investigation usually starts at the level of the individual.<br>
<img src="img63.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
A population is a group of interbreeding organisms that are members
of the same species living in the same area at the same time. Members
of the same population may compete with each other for food, water,
mates, or other resources. Some species have adaptations that reduce
competition within a population. For instance, frogs have a life cycle
in which the young tadpoles and adult frogs look very different and
have different diets. Tadpoles eat algae and adult frogs eat insects;
therefore, they are not competing with each other for food.<br><br>


What is a biological community?<br>


A biological community consists of the different species within an
area, typically a three-dimensional space, and the interactions within
and among these species. Examples of interactions include predation,
parasitism, herbivory, competition, and pollination. In a biological
community, changes in one population may cause changes in other
populations. For instance, if the number of mouse-eating birds (e.g.,
hawks) in a community increases slightly, the number of mice in that
community will decrease slightly. In a healthy forest community, there
are many populations that depend on each other. These might include
birds eating insects, mushrooms growing from decaying leaves or bark. While these populations are connected to each other, they are
all affected by abiotic factors. These relationships between different
populations and their surroundings create an ecosystem.<br><br>


6.1.4. <u>Ecosystems</u><br><br>


The community of organisms in a habitat, plus the non-living part
of the environment (e.g., air, water, soil, light, etc.) makes up an
ecosystem. A lake is an ecosystem, which consists of the plant and
animal communities mentioned above, and the water, minerals,
dissolved oxygen, soil and sunlight on which they depend. An
ecosystem is self-supporting. In a woodland ecosystem, the plants
absorb light and rainwater for photosynthesis; the animals feed on
the plants and on each other. The dead remains of animals and plants,
acted upon by fungi and bacteria, return nutrients to the soil.<br>


Lakes and ponds are clear examples of ecosystems. Sunlight, water
and minerals allow the plants to grow and support animal life. The
recycling of materials from the dead organisms maintains the supply
of nutrients. So, a population of carp forms part of the animal
communityliving in a habitatcalled a lake. The communities in this
habitat, together with their watery environment, make up a selfsupporting ecosystem. A carp is a secondary consumerat the top of a
food chain, where it is in competitionwith other species of fish for food
and with other carp for food and mates. The whole of that part of the
Earth’s surface which contains living organisms (called thebiosphere)
may be regarded as one vast ecosystem. No new material (in significant
amounts) enters the Earth’s ecosystem from space and there is no
significant loss of materials. The whole system depends on a constant
input of energy from the Sun and recycling of the chemical elements.<br><br>


Types of ecosystems<br>


An ecosystem is made of all of the different populations in a biological
community and the community’s abiotic factors. There are two major
kinds of ecosystems—terrestrial and aquatic. Terrestrial ecosystems
are those located on land. Examples include forests, fields, and a
rotting log. Aquatic ecosystems are found in both freshwater and salt
water. Freshwater ecosystems include ponds, lakes, and streams.
Oceans are a type of saltwater, or marine, ecosystem.<br><br>


6.1.5 <u>Biomes</u><br><br>

A biome is a major terrestrial or aquatic life zone characterized by
vegetation type in terrestrial biomes and the physical environment in
aquatic biomes. In this section, we will briefly survey the terrestrial
biomes, followed by the aquatic biomes.<br><br>

Terrestrial Biomes<br>

Terrestrial biomes vary greatly. For example, at the North Pole, the
weather is very cold and there are no plants. As you move south,
the weather gets warmer and there is a change in the size, number,
and kinds of plants that cover the ground. As you continue south,
the temperatures rise and you encounter forests. Still farther south

are grasslands and deserts, with high summer temperatures and
little rainfall. Near the equator, you find abundant growth and much
rainfall.<br><br>

What are the tropical rain forests?<br>

Tropical rain forests of evergreen broad-leaf trees form between
latitudes 10° north and south in equatorial Africa, the East Indies,
Southeast Asia, South America, and Central America. Rain that falls
throughout the year sums to an annual total of 130 to 200 centimetres.
Regular rains, combined with an average temperature of 25°C (77°F)
and little variation in day length, allow photosynthesis to continue
year-round.<br>

Plants are vertically layered, and competition for light is intense. Broad-leaf evergreen trees are dominant in tropical rain
forests. Tropical forests are home to millions of animal species. In
fact, animal diversity is higher in tropical forests than in any other
terrestrial biome. The animal species includes amphibians, birds and
reptiles, mammals and arthropods. Deforestation is an ongoing threat
to tropical rain forests. Tropical forests are located in developing
countries with fast-growing human populations who look to the
forest as a source of lumber, fuel, and potential agricultural land.
Deforestation in any region leaves fewer trees to remove carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere.<br>
<img src="img64.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
<br>


What is a desert?<br>

Deserts receive an average of less than 10 centimetres of rain per year.
Maximum air temperature in hot deserts may exceed 50°C while in cold deserts air temperature may fall below –30°C. They cover
about one-fifth of Earth’s land surface and many are located at about
30°north and south latitude. Examples of desert biome include Chile’s
Atacama Desert and China’s Gobi desert. Lack of rainfall keeps the
humidity in deserts low. With little water vapor to block the sun’s rays,
intense sunlight reaches and heats the ground. At night, the lack of
insulating water vapour in the air allows the temperature to fall fast.
The plants include succulents such as cacti or euphorbs, deeply
rooted shrubs, and herbs that grow during the infrequent moist
periods (Fig.6.5). Desert plant adaptations include tolerance of heat
and desiccation, water storage, and reduced leaf surface area. The
desert fauna include snakes and lizards, scorpions, ants, beetles,
migratory and resident birds, and seed-eating rodents. Many species
are nocturnal. Water conservation is a common adaptation with
some species surviving solely on water obtained from breaking down
carbohydrates in seeds. Urbanization and conversion to irrigated
agriculture has reduced the natural biodiversity of some deserts.<br>
<img src="img65.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
<br>



What are Savannas?<br>


The Savanna biome occurs in equatorial and sub-equatorial regions.
Savannas lie between the tropical forests and hot deserts of Africa,
India, and Australia. Africa’s savannas are famous for their abundant
wildlife. The precipitation averages 30–50 cm per year while the dry
season can last up to eight or nine months. The temperature is warm
year-round, averaging 24–29°C.
The biome is characterized by scattered trees found at different
densities. Fires are common in the dry season, and the dominant plant species are fire-adapted and tolerant of seasonal drought.
Grasses and small non-woody plants make are common. These plants
grow rapidly in response to seasonal rains and are tolerant of grazing
by large mammals and other herbivores (Fig.6.6).Herbivores include
giraffes, zebras, elephants, a variety of antelopes, and immense herds
of wildebeests. Lions and hyenas are carnivores that eat the grazers.
During seasonal droughts, grazing mammals often migrate to parts
of the savanna with more forage and scattered watering holes. The
earliest humans may have lived in savannas. Fires set by humans may
help maintain this biome, though overly frequent fires reduce tree
regeneration by killing the seedlings and saplings. Cattle ranching
and over-hunting have led to declines in large-mammal populations.<br>
<img src="img66.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
<br>


What are temperate grasslands?<br>


Temperate grasslands are warm in summer, but cold in winter. Annual
rainfall is 25 to100 centimeters, with rains throughout the year. Grass
roots extend profusely through the thick topsoil and help hold it in
place, preventing erosion by the constant winds. North America’s
grasslands are shortgrass and tallgrass prairies. During the 1930s,
much of the shortgrass prairie of the American Great Plains was
plowed to grow wheat. Tallgrass prairie has somewhat richer topsoil
and slightly more frequent rainfall than shortgrass prairie. Nearly all
tallgrass prairie has now been converted to cropland. The Tallgrass
Prairie National Preserve was created in 1996 to protect the little that
remains. North America’s prairies once supported enormous herds of
elk, pronghorn antelope, and bison that were prey to wolves (Fig.6.7).
Today, these predators and prey are absent from most of their former
range.<br>
<img src="img67.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
<br>


What are Boreal Forests?<br>


The boreal forest, also known as taiga or coniferous forest, is found
south of the Arctic Circle and across most of Canada, Alaska, Russia,
and northern Europe. This biome has cold, dry winters and short,
cool, wet summers. The annual precipitation is from 40 cm to 100 cm
and usually takes the form of snow. Little evaporation occurs because
of the cold temperatures.
The long and cold winters in the boreal forest have led to the
predominance of cold-tolerant cone-bearing (coniferous) plants.
These are evergreen coniferous trees like pines and spruce which
retain their needle-shaped leaves year-round (Figure 6.8). This
benefits evergreen trees, which grow faster than deciduous trees in
the boreal forest. In addition, soils in boreal forest regions tend to be
acidic with little available nitrogen. Plant species diversity is less than
that seen in temperate forests and tropical wet forests.<br>
<img src="img68.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
<br>
What is the temperate broad-leaf forest?<br>

Temperate broad-leaf forest is found mainly at mid-latitudes in the
Northern Hemisphere, with smaller areas in Chile, South Africa,
Australia, and New Zealand. The precipitation can average from
about 70 to over 200 cm annually. In winter temperatures average 0°C
while in summers, with temperatures up to 35°C, are hot and humid.
The dominant plants are deciduous trees, which drop their leaves
before winter, when low temperatures would reduce photosynthesis
and make water uptake from frozen soil difficult(Fig.6.9).Many
mammals hibernate in winter, while many bird species migrate to
warmer climates.
Temperate broad-leaf forest has been heavily settled on all continents.
Logging and land clearing for agriculture and urban development
cleared virtually all the original deciduous forests in North America.
However, owing to their capacity for recovery, these forests are
returning over much of their former range.<br>
<img src="img69.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
<br>


What are the tundras?<br>


Cover expansive areas of the Arctic, amounting to 20% of Earth’s land
surface. The precipitation averages from 20 to 60 cm annually in arctic
tundra but may exceed 100 cm in alpine tundra. Winters are cold,
with averages in some areas below –30°C while summer temperatures
generally average less than 10°C. High winds and low temperatures
produce similar plant communities, called alpine tundra, on very
high mountaintops at all latitudes, including the tropics.
The vegetation of tundra is mostly herbaceous, consisting of a mixture
of mosses, grasses, and forbs, along with some dwarf shrubs and trees
and lichens. A permanently frozen layer of soil called permafrost restricts the growth of plant roots (Figure 6.10).Large grazing musk
oxen are resident, while caribou and reindeer are migratory. Predators
include bears, wolves, and foxes. Many bird species migrate to the
tundra for summer nesting. The major human impact are mineral
and oil extraction.<br>
<img src="img70.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
<br>


Aquatic biomes<br>

Aquatic biomes, which occupy roughly 75% of Earth’s surface, are
determined by their salinity and other physical factors. Freshwater
biomes (lakes, streams and rivers, and wetlands) typically have salt
concentrations of less than 1%. The salt concentrations of marine
biomes (oceans, intertidal zones, and coral reefs) are generally around
3%.<br><br>

What are the lakes?<br>

Standing bodies of water range from ponds a few square meters in
area to lakes covering thousands of square kilometres. The salinity,
oxygen concentration, and nutrient content differ greatly among lakes
and can vary with season.
Rooted and floating aquatic plants in lakes live close to shore. Here,
sunlight penetrates all the way to the lake bottom; aquatic plants and
algae that attach to the bottom are the primary producers. Also a
variety of phytoplankton, including cyanobacteria and zooplankton
live in the open water zone of a lake. Fishes live in all zones with
sufficient oxygen. Runoff from fertilized land and dumping of wastes
lead to nutrient enrichment, which can produce large numbers of
algae (an algal “bloom”) oxygen depletion, and fish kills.<br>
<img src="img71.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
<br>

What are the wetlands?<br>

Wetlands are environments in which the soil is either permanently
or periodically saturated with water. Wetlands are different from lakes
because wetlands are shallow bodies of water. There are several types
of wetlands including marshes, swamps, bogs, mudflats, and salt
marshes.
Because of high organic production by plants and decomposition
by microbes and other organisms, both the water and the soils are periodic low in dissolved oxygen. Wetlands have a high capacity to
filter dissolved nutrients and chemical pollutants (Fig.6.12).Wetlands
are among the most productive biomes on Earth.
Woody plants dominate the vegetation of swamps, while bogs are
dominated by sphagnum mosses. Wetlands are home to a diverse
community of invertebrates, birds, and many other organisms.
Wetlands help purify water and reduce peak flooding. Draining and
filling have destroyed up to 90% of wetlands in Europe.<br>
<img src="img72.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
<br>


What are streams and rivers?<br>

The most prominent physical characteristic of streams and rivers is the
speed and volume of their flow. Headwater streams are generally cold,
clear, swift, and turbulent. Farther downstream, where numerous
tributaries may have joined, forming a river, the water is generally
warmer and more turbid because of suspended sediment (Fig.6.13).
The salt and nutrient content of streams and rivers increases from the
headwaters to the mouth. Headwaters are generally rich in oxygen.
A great diversity of fishes and invertebrates inhabit unpolluted rivers
and streams.Municipal, agricultural, and industrial pollution degrade
water quality and kill aquatic organisms. Damming and flood control
impair the natural functioning of stream and river ecosystems and
threaten migratory species such as salmon.<br>
<img src="img73.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
<br>


What are estuaries?<br>


An estuary is a transition area between river and sea. Seawater flows
up the estuary channel during a rising tide and flows back down during
the falling tide. Often, higher-density seawater occupies the bottom
of the channel and mixes little with the lower-density river water at
the surface (Fig.6.14).Salinity varies spatially within estuaries, from
nearly that of fresh water to that of seawater. Nutrients from the river
make estuaries, like wetlands, among the most productive biomes.
Saltmarsh grasses and algae, including phytoplankton, are the major
producers in estuaries. Estuaries support an abundance of worms,
oysters, crabs, and many fish species that humans consume. Many
marine invertebrates and fishes use estuaries as a breeding ground or
migrate through them to freshwater habitats upstream. Estuaries are
also crucial feeding areas for waterfowl and some marine mammals.
Filling, dredging, and pollution from upstream have disrupted
estuaries worldwide.<br>
<img src="img74.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
<br>


6.1.6 <u>Ecological succession</u><br><br>


Changes in the composition of terrestrial communities are most
apparent after a severe disturbance, such as a volcanic eruption or
a glacier, strips away all the existing vegetation. The disturbed area
may be colonized by a variety of species, which are gradually replaced
by other species, which are in turn replaced by still other species—a
process called ecological succession. When this process begins in a
virtually lifeless area, such as on a new volcanic island or on the rubble
(moraine) left by a retreating glacier, it is called primary succession.<br>
<img src="img75.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>

During primary succession, the only life-forms initially present
are often prokaryotes and protists. Lichens and mosses, which
grow from windblown spores, are commonly the first macroscopic
photosynthesizers to colonize such areas. Soil develops gradually as
rocks weather and organic matter accumulates from the decomposed
remains of the early colonizers. Once soil is present, the lichens
and mosses are usually overgrown by grasses, shrubs, and trees
that sprout from seeds blown in from nearby areas or carried in by
animals. Eventually, an area is colonized by plants that become the
community’s dominant form of vegetation (climax community).
Producing such a community through primary succession may take
hundreds or thousands of years. Early-arriving species and laterarriving ones may be linked by one of three key processes- facilitating
inhibiting and tolerating.<br>


In contrast to primary succession, secondary succession involves the
re-colonization of an area after a major disturbance has removed most but not all of the organisms in a community. Following the
disturbance, the area may return to something like its original state.
For instance, in a forested area that has been cleared for farming and
later abandoned, the earliest plants to recolonize are often herbaceous
species that grow from windblown or animal-borne seeds. If the area
has not been burned or heavily grazed, woody shrubs may in time
replace most of the herbaceous species, and forest trees may eventually
replace most of the shrubs.<br>
<img src="img76.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
<br>



6.2. <u>Ecological relationships</u><br><br>


Some key relationships in the life of an organism are its interactions
with individuals of other species in the community. These interspecific interactions include competition, predation, herbivory,
parasitism, mutualism, and commensalism.<br><br>


Competition(-/-)<br>


What is a competition?<br>

Competition is interaction that occurs when individuals of
different/same species each use a resource that limits the survival
and reproduction of both individuals. Weeds growing in a garden compete with garden plants for soil nutrients and water.
Predators compete for prey such as hares. In contrast, some resources,
such as oxygen, are rarely in short supply on land; most terrestrial
species use this resource but do not usually compete for it.<br>
<img src="img77.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
<br>


Predation (+/-)<br>

What is predation?<br>

Predation is interaction in which an individual of one species,
the predator, kills and eats an individual of the other species, the
prey(Fig.6.18). For example, a rotifer (a tiny aquatic animal that is
smaller than many unicellular protists) that kills a protist by eating it
can also be considered a predator. Because eating and avoiding being
eaten are prerequisites to reproductive success, the adaptations of
both predators and prey tend to be refined through natural selection.<br>
<img src="img78.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
<br>

Herbivory (+/-)<br>

What is herbivory?<br>

Herbivory is an exploitative interaction in which an organism—
an herbivore—eats parts of a plant or alga, thereby harming it but
usually not killing it. Examples of herbivores include cattle, sheep,
giraffe and goat. However, most herbivores are invertebrates, such as
grasshoppers, caterpillars, and beetles. Herbivores have
many specialized adaptations. Many herbivorous insects have sensors
on their feet that enable them to distinguish between plants based on
their toxicity or nutritional value. Goats also use their sense of smell
to examine plants, rejecting some and eating others. Other herbivores
also have specialized teeth or digestive systems adapted for processing
vegetation.<br>
<img src="img79.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
<br>


Parasitism (+/-)<br>


What is parasitism?<br>


Parasitism is exploitative interaction in which one organism, the
parasite, derives its nourishment from another organism, its host,
which is harmed in the process. Endoparasites such as
parasitic roundworms live and feed inside their host. An ectoparasite
such as a tick feeds while attached to a host’s external surface. Many
parasites have complex life cycles involving multiple hosts. The
blood fluke, which currently infects approximately 200 million
people around the world, requires two hosts at different times in its
development: humans and freshwater snails.<br>
<img src="img80.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
<br>


Mutualism (+/+)<br>


What are the effects of participating in a mutualism?<br>


Mutualism is interaction that benefits individuals of both of the
interacting species. Mutualisms are common in nature, including
cellulose digestion by microorganisms in the digestive systems of
termites and ruminant mammals, animals that pollinate flowers or
disperse seeds, nutrient exchange between fungi and plant roots
in mycorrhizae, and photosynthesis by unicellular algae in corals. In some mutualisms, such as the acacia-ant, each of the
interacting individuals depends on the other for their survival and
reproduction. Both partners in a mutualism incur costs as well
as benefits. In mycorrhizae, for example, the plant often transfers
carbohydrates to the fungus, while the fungus transfers limiting
nutrients, such as phosphorus, to the plant.<br>
<img src="img81.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
<br>

Commensalism(+/0)<br>

What is a commensalism?<br>

Commensalism is interaction that neither benefits the individuals
of one of the interacting species but neither harms nor helps the
individuals of the other species. For instance, cattle egrets feed on
insects flushed out of the grass by grazing bison, cattle, horses, and
other herbivores. Because the birds increase their feeding
rates when following the herbivores, they clearly benefit from the
association. Much of the time, the herbivores are not affected by the
birds. At times, however, the herbivores too may derive some benefit;
for example, the birds may remove and eat ticks and other ectoparasites
from the herbivores’ skin, or they may warn the herbivores of a
predator’s approach.<br>

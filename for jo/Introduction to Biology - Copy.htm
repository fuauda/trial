1.1 <u>Definition of Biology</u><br><br>
Biology came from two
Greek words bios means life,
and logos meaning study. Biology is the scientific study of life or living things.
It seems very difficult to objectively define life in a simple sentence.
But, we recognize life mainly by common characteristics shared by
living systems.
Living things:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>are composed of one or more cells</li>
<li>are complex and highly ordered</li>
<li>can respond to stimuli, grow, reproduce, etc.</li>
<li>transmit genetic information to their offspring</li>
<li>need the energy to accomplish work</li>
<li>can maintain relatively constant internal conditions (homeostasis)</li>
<li>are capable of evolutionary adaptation to the environment .etc.</li>
</ul><br>
Biologists study about living things using a scientific method that
involves asking questions, suggesting possible answers; and testing for
the validity of the answers through experimentation. This scientific
study follows the study of structures and processes that we can verify
observe and measure, either directly or indirectly with the help of
tools and technology, such as microscopes.<br>
The study of biology is a point of merging information and tools
from all natural sciences. For example information about naturally
occurring elements in living organisms, chemical bonding, molecules,
acids ,bases and other related things can be studied using the tools and
principles of chemistry. Other scientific concept like conversion of
radiant energy into organic molecules by photo-synthesis is studied
with the knowledge of chemistry and Physics.<br><br>
1.2 <u>Why do we study Biology?</u><br><br>
Human beings have an inborn curiosity about the natural world
that leads them to study about living organisms and their habitats.
Studying biology helps to understand how living things work, how
they function and interact with the environment. Biology touches our
everyday life in many ways. For example, biologists have discovered
drugs that are used to treat different human diseases. Many biologists
are working on problems that critically affect our lives, such as how
our animals and plants body work, how ecosystems work, how
advancements in genetics and cell biology are transforming to medicine
and agriculture, as well as the use of forensics biology to investigate
crime, Furthermore, studies how ecology is helping societies evaluate
environmental issues, such as global warming, how fermentation is
used to produce alcoholic drinks such as beer and wine. In addition,
biological studies are used in treating patients suffering from AIDS,
tuberculosis, and some types of cancer.<br><br>
1.3. <u>The Scientific Method</u><br><br>
Biology is a science of inquiry.
Biologists are always curious about why things happen or how things
happen. By asking questions and seeking science-based responses
known as the scientific method, they come up with new theories to
explain new findings. The scientific method involves a series of steps
that guide scientists through such scientific investigations. Biologists
study the living world by posing questions about it. The general steps
of the Scientific methods are:<br>
1.<u>Observation</u>: The scientific study begins with careful observations (often a problem
to solve) that leads to a question. The observations can be made either
directly (e.g. using your sense organs) or indirectly using scientific
tools such as microscopes.<br>
2.<u>Asking Questions</u>: The observations usually lead the scientist to ask questions (inquiry).<br>
Forming of a hypothesis: A hypothesis is proposed scientific explanations (possible answers)
for a set of question(s).To solve a problem, one can propose several
hypotheses. Scientific hypotheses should be testable.<br>
3.<u>Testing the hypothesis</u>: Hypothesis can be tested through experimentation. Any scientific
experiment must have the ability to be duplicated because the “answer”
the scientist comes up with (whether it supports or rejects the original
hypothesis) can’t become part of the scientific knowledge unless other
scientists can perform the same experiment and achieve the similar
results. If a hypothesis is not supported by experimental data, one can
propose a new hypothesis.<br>
4.<u>Making conclusions about the findings</u>: Scientists consider their original hypotheses and ask whether they
could still be right in light of the new information gathered during the
experiment. If so, the hypotheses can remain as possible explanations
for how things work. If not, scientists reject the hypotheses and try
to come up with alternate explanations (new hypotheses) that can
explain what they’ve seen.<br>
5.<u>Communicating the findings</u>: When scientists complete some work, they write a paper that explains
exactly what they did and the results they obtained. Then, they submit
the paper to a scientific journal in their field. In addition, the findings will be printed in scientific journals and assist teachers and students
in the field.<br><br>
1.4. <u>Tools of a Biologist</u><br><br>
Biologists use different types of tools in the laboratory and field for
scientific investigations. Some of the tools are used for measuring,
some are used for observation and some are used for culturing
microorganisms.<br><br>
1.4.1. <u>Laboratory tools of biologist</u><br><br>
Hand lens: Most cells cannot be seen with the naked eye. A hand lens has a higher
magnification than our naked eye. It consists of a convex lens fixed
within a circular metallic loop and is attached to a metallic or wooden
handle.
The main function of hand lens is to provide an enlarged image of the
object placed under it. But hand lens is not sufficient to observe the
detail in cells. There is a need for providing high magnifications tools
such as microscope.<br><img src="img8.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
The Microscope
One of the most important tools of the biologist is a microscope. A
microscope is an instrument used to study objects that are too small
to be seen with a naked eye. The microscope magnifies the image of
small objects making them visible to the human eye. For example,
microscopes are used to observe the shape of bacteria, fungi and
parasites.
There are several kinds of microscopes. The major types are: light microscope and electron microscope.
A light microscope is called light microscope because it uses a beam
of light to view specimens. There are two types of light microscopes,
Simple light microscope which consists of a single lens while a
compound light microscope consists of two or more glass lenses.
A compound light microscope is the most common microscope used
in biology. It consists of two lens systems (a combination of lenses) to
magnify the image of an object up to 2000x. Each lens has a different
magnifying power. A compound light microscope with a single eyepiece is called monocular; one with two eye-pieces is said to be
binocular.
When we observe an image under light microscope, light rays are
focused on to the image on a microscope slide. This Light which
transmitted through the specimen is then focused by two types of
lenses known as eye and objective lens. The enlarged produced by
these two lenses. A compound light microscope magnification is the
product of eye and objective lenses, ×10 eyepiece and ×40 objective,
the total magnification is ×400.
Electron microscopes on the other hand use a beam of electrons
(instead of a beam of light) and electromagnets (instead of glass lenses)
to enlarge the image of an object. These microscopes provide a higher
magnification than light microscopes and are used for observing
extremely small microorganisms such as viruses.<br>
Glass slides and cover slips: The microscope slides are used to
support an specimens being examined under the microscope.<br><img src="img9.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
The cover slips are the small square or circle shaped thin glass sheets
that are used to cover specimens on the glass slide to protect from
further addition of any chemical or dirt and it is also used to protect
the microscope and prevent the slide from drying by locking the
moisture. Cover slides provide better view under the microscope.
Although the tool most closely associated with a biologist is the
microscope, there are several common tools used by biologists in the
laboratory and on field.<br><img src="img10.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
Autoclave: is the equipment used to sterilize (kill microorganisms)
different biological samples. An autoclave sterilizes contaminated
materials including culture media, and bacterial spores by exposing
them to high temperatures and highly pressurized steam.<br><img src="img11.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
Culturing is the procedure used to grow microorganisms in a
controlled environment. Many microorganisms reproduce very
quickly. Culturing of micro-organisms also have important function
like in medicine (Penicillin) and for food (beverage) preparation.
Wine and beer making uses culturing on a large scale, as it does in
cheese making, biofuel production, and many other endeavors.
There are many ways of killing microorganisms, including chemical
disinfectants, flame, dry or wet heat, ultraviolet light, and ionizing
radiation such as X-rays or gamma rays. The problem is, some bacteria
form spores, which are resistant to chemical disinfectants, including
bleach. In these situations, it is very important to use autoclaving
which kill microorganisms as well as their spores.<br>
Incubator: is a device used to maintain a specific environment for
culturing. An incubator is an instrument that maintains the temperature
best suited for the growth of different types of microorganisms.<br><img src="img12.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
Petri dishes: are flat dishes with a matching cover of a slightly larger
diameter. They are available in glass and plastic form. Petri dishes
are used with gelling culturing media, such as agar, and placed in the
autoclave to sterilize it.<br><img src="img13.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
Culture tubes: are available in a huge range of sizes, shapes, materials,
and so on. They are used to culture microorganisms. Culture tubes
may be used with solid (gel) culturing media or with liquid (broth)
culturing media, and then placed in the autoclave for sterilization.<br><img src="img14.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
Flasks: is an apparatus having a flat bottom and a long narrow neck,
which allows easy mixing of the solution without spilling out the
content . it is also used to gently heat the content inside with a gentle
swirling motion of the flask . It is essentially a large-volume culture
tube that is used only with broth media and flasks are used to produce
large populations of microorganisms. They are available in a variety
of shapes and sizes.<br><img src="img15.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
Balance: is useful for making up solutions accurately, weighing
specimens, and so on.<br><img src="img16.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
Dropper: A dropper consists of a glass tube that has a small opening
at one end and is attached to a vacuum rubber bulb at the other end. A
dropper is used when it is required to control the amount of solution
being added to a reaction.<br><img src="img17.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
Tongs are metallic scissors-shaped laboratory instruments. It is used
to Lifting or picking up hot objects such as heated crucible, beakers,
dishes, or flasks.<br><img src="img18.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>

Dissecting Tool Kit is used to dissect animals such as frogs, fetal pigs,
mice, etc. It consists of all the necessary tools required to carry out
the process of dissection such as a catheter, groove probe, scalpel,
surgical scissors (straight and curved), mayo scissors (straight and
curved), dissecting forceps (with and without teeth), dissecting pin,
etc.<br><img src="img19.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>

Dissecting pan is equipment is used as a pan on which the specimen is
kept while it is being dissected to study its internal organs.<br><img src="img20.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>

Crucible is a small container made up of ceramic or metal which is
able to withstand high temperatures, and therefore, it is generally
used to melt elements.<br><img src="img21.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>

Beaker is a cylindrical glass container used for making up solutions,
holding hot or cold water or ice baths, and so on.<br><img src="img22.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
Hotplate is useful for heating solutions, making up an agar culturing
medium, and so on.<br><img src="img23.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
pH meter is used to measure the pH (acidity or basicity) of substances.<br><img src="img24.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
Thermometer is an instrument that measures the temperature of
substances.<br><img src="img25.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
Forceps are used to hold or pick up small objects. They are available
in a variety of shapes and sizes.<br><img src="img26.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
A spatula is used for mixing substances into a solution, stirring the
solution, and scrapping objects. It is shaped like a spoon.<br>
Wash bottles which are mainly used to rinse various laboratory
materials.<br><img src="img27.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>

Wash bottles are flexible in nature that allows the user
to adjust the water pressure as per the need by squeezing the bottle
accordingly.<br><img src="img28.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
Bunsen burner or alcohol burner produces a single open flame and it is used for heating
and sterilization purposes in the various experiments conducted in
labs.<br><img src="img29.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br><br>
1.4.2. <u>Field tools</u><br><br>
Insect nets –It is insect collecting nets which is composed of some
sort of net bag made of cloth or fine mesh that is attached to a wire
loop, which is attached to a wooden or metal pole.<br>
Fishing net is a net used for fishing. Nets are devices made from
fibers woven in a grid-like structure. Some fishing nets are also
called fish traps.<br><img src="img30.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>

Fishing nets are usually meshes formed by tying a
relatively thin thread.<br><img src="img31.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br><br>
1.5. <u>Handling and using a light Microscope</u><br><br>
Most microscopes have several different powerful lenses attached
to them, allowing the viewer to inspect the content at more than
100 times its actual size. Biology as modern science would not exist
without the microscope, and good microscopes are essential for dayto-day activities for most biologists. In addition to their importance,
microscopes are extremely expensive, therefore it is very important
to know the function of all structures of microscope and handle the
device properly before we are using it in the laboratory.<br><br>
1.5.1. <u>The parts and function of the light microscope</u><br><br>
Microscopes are generally made up of structural parts for holding and
supporting the microscope and its components and the optical parts
which are used for magnification and viewing of the specimen images.
This section define the parts of a microscope and the functions they
perform to enable the visualization of specimens.<br>
Eyepiece is the part found at the top of the microscope and is used
to look through the microscope. It is also named as the ocular. Its
standard magnification is 10x with an optional eyepiece having
magnifications from 5X to 30X.<br>
Eyepiece tube is the eyepiece holder. It carries the eyepiece just above
the objective lens. In some microscopes such as the binoculars, the
eyepiece tube is flexible and can be rotated for maximum visualization.<br>
Objective lenses are major lenses that further magnify the specimen at
different intensities with multiple objective lenses. Mostly they have a
magnification power of 40x-100X.<br>
Arm is a holder connected to all components that function as a support
for the microscope so that the microscope can be used properly.<br>
Body tube connects the eyepiece to the objective lenses.<br>
Nose piece is rotating mount that holds many objective lenses.. It is
movable hence it allows to change the magnification.<br>
The Adjustment knobs are knobs that are used to focus the microscope.
There are two types of adjustment knobs i.e. fine adjustment knobs
and coarse adjustment knobs. Fine adjustment: regulate the distance between object and objective,
to achieve the necessary sharpness. The fine focus moves the stage
only minimally. Coarse adjustment: Brings specimen into general focus. Coarse
adjustment also moves the stage to adjust the difference between the
object and the objective. The function of the coarse focus is to capture
the exact distance roughly and quickly.<br>
Stage is the section in which the specimen is placed for viewing.<br>
Stage clip acts as a holder for the object plate and ensures that it doesn’t
fall out of place accidentally.<br>
Aperture is a hole on the microscope stage, through which the
transmitted light from the source reaches the stage.<br>
Microscopic illuminator is the microscopes light source, located at the
base. It is used instead of a mirror. It captures light from an external
source of a low voltage of about 100V.<br>
Condensers are lenses that are used to collect and focus light from the
illuminator into the specimen. They are found under the stage next to
the diaphragm of the microscope. They play a major role in ensuring
clear sharp images are produced with a high magnification of 400X
and above.<br>
Diaphragm is also known as the iris. It is found under the stage of the
microscope and its primary role is to control the amount of light that
reaches the specimen. It’s an adjustable apparatus, hence controlling
the light intensity and the size of the beam of light that gets to the
specimen.<br>
Base is the very bottom part. Base serves to accommodate all parts of
the light microscope.<br><br>
1.6. <u>General Laboratory Safety Rules</u><br><br>
Safety is the condition of being protected from harm or other danger.
Safety can also refer to the control of recognized hazards in order to
achieve an acceptable level of risk. Laboratory safety is important
before we do any activities in the laboratory: working carefully in the laboratory, dealing with minor problems before they become major problems and keeping safety constantly in mind are some of the safety rules.<br>
Important general laboratory safety rules are:<br>
1. Following the instructions: It is critical to read and listen the laboratory procedure and be familiar
with all the steps, from start to finish. It is very important to know
how to use all of the lab equipment before you begin.<br>
2. Knowing the location of safety equipment: It is mandatory to have a fire extinguisher and first-aid kit readily
in the laboratory. It’s important to know the location of the safety
equipment and how to use it. It’s a good idea to periodically check
equipment to make sure it is in working order. Review lab safety signs
and look for them before starting an experiment.<br>
3. Dressing for the laboratory: It is important to wear protective cloths including a laboratory coat,
safety goggles, gloves, hearing protection, long pants, a long-sleeve
shirt, and leather shoes or boots that fully cover your feet(NO sandals).
Wear a disposable respirator mask when you handle chemicals that
are toxic. The dressing procedure should be based on the nature of
the experiment.<br>
4. Never eat or drink in the laboratory: Don’t eat or drink in the science laboratory. It is forbidden to store
food or beverages in the same refrigerator that contains experiments,
chemicals, or cultures.<br>
5. Never taste or sniff chemicals: Avoid tasting or smelling chemicals or biological cultures. Tasting or
smelling some chemicals can be dangerous or even deadly. The best
way to know what’s in a container is to label it and read before use,
so get in the habit of making a label for glassware before adding the
chemical.<br>
6. Act responsibly in the laboratory: Never randomly mixing chemicals to see what happens. It may result
an explosion, fire, or release of toxic gases.<br>
7. Cleaning the experiment area in the laboratory and storing the
waste properly: Every laboratory session should begin and end with your glassware,
chemicals, and laboratory equipment clean and stored properly.<br>
8. Handling chemicals properly: Wear a disposable respirator mask when handle chemicals that are
toxic. Never allow laboratory chemicals to contact your bare skin.<br>
9. Know what to do with laboratory accidents: If someone burn or if he exposed to chemical immediately flood the
burned area with cold tap water for several minutes to minimize the
damage done by the burn.<br>
10. All laboratory personnel should place emphasis on safety and
chemical hygiene at all times: Never leave containers of chemicals open. All containers must have
appropriate labels. Unlabelled chemicals should never be used.

4.1 <u>Introduction to reproduction</u><br><br>
Reproduction is one of the unique characteristics of life. The ability of
organisms to reproduce to form their own kind is the one characteristic
that best distinguishes living things from non living matter. Two
modes of reproduction are recognized: asexual and sexual. In asexual
reproduction, there is only one parent and with no special reproductive
organs or cells. Each organism is capable of producing identical copies of itself as soon as it becomes an adult. Sexual reproduction as a rule
involves two parents, each of which contributes special germ cells (egg
or sperm) that in union (fertilization) develop into a new individual.<br><br>
4.2 <u>Asexual reproduction</u><br><br>
Asexual reproduction is the production of individuals without gametes
(eggs or sperm). It includes a number of distinct processes, all without
involving sex or a second parent. Asexual reproduction appears in
bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes and in many invertebrates,
fungi and plants. However, asexual reproduction is absent among
vertebrates. The basic forms of asexual reproduction are fission
(binary and multiple), budding, and fragmentation. For example, a
small piece of stem planted in the soil may form roots and grow into a
complete plant.<br>
Asexual reproduction has couple of advantages - no mate is needed;
no gametes are needed; all the good characteristics of the parent
are passed on to the offspring; and offspring will grow in the same
favourable environment as the parent. Plants that reproduce
asexually usually store large amounts of food that allow survival.
The disadvantages are there is little variation created, so adaptation
to a changing environment (evolution) is unlikely. If the parent has
no resistance to a particular disease, none of the offspring will have
resistance. Lack of dispersal can lead to competition for nutrients,
water and light.<br><br>
4.3 <u>Types of asexual reproduction</u><br><br>
4.3.1 Fission<br><br>
In fission, the organism divides into two (binary fission) or more
(multiple fission) equal parts. Binary fission is common among
bacteria, algae and protozoa. In binary fission, the body of the
unicellular parent divides by mitosis into two approximately equal
parts, each of which grows into an individual similar to the parent. In
bacteria, the cell simply divides into two and each new cell becomes
an independent organism. However, before a bacterium
divides, the bacterial nucleus is replicated (copied) to produce two
identical copies so that the daughter cells receive one copy each.
Alternatively, the nucleus of the orgasms divide repeatedly and each
daughter nucleus breaks away together with a small portion of the
cytoplasm, resulting in the production of many daughter cells. This
is common among some parasitic protozoa, for example, malarial
parasites. Also, some invertebrates reproduce through fission.<br>

<br>
4.3.2 Fragmentation<br><br>
Fragmentation is one of the most common modes of asexual
reproduction involving the breakdown of a parent organism into
parts that develop into whole organism. Fragmentation is observed
in fungi, plants, animals and algae. For Example, Spirogyra, the
filamentous green-algae undergoes fragmentation which results in
many filaments. Each filament grows into matured filament.<br>
Also a multicellular animal (e.g.,worms) breaks into two or more
parts, with each fragment capable of becoming a complete individual.
Many invertebrates can reproduce asexually by simply breaking into
two parts and then regenerating the missing parts of the fragments.<br>
<img src="iimagewow/img48.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
<br>
4.3.3 Budding<br><br>
Another common type of asexual reproduction is budding. In this
mode of reproduction, the organism divides into two unequal parts.
It is common in fugal species and invertebrates. During the process, a
bulge forms on the side of the cell, the nucleus divides mitotically, and
the bud ultimately detaches itself from the mother cell. For example,
in some fungi such as yeasts, a bud develops on the surface of either
the yeast cell or the hypha, with the cytoplasm of the bud being
continuous with that of the parent cell. The nucleus of the parent cell
then divides; one of the daughter nuclei migrates into the bud, and
the other remains in the parent cell. Budding also occurs
commonly in some invertebrate animals.<br>
<img src="iimagewow/img49.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
The majority of fungi, however, reproduce asexually by the formation
of spores (i.e., sporulation). Spores are dispersed often by air currents
and if they reach a suitable situation, they grow new hyphae. The
hyphae develop into a mycelium. At the tip of the
hyphae, a swelling or sporangium ï¿½ spore case forms. Penicillium and
Mucor are examples of mould fungi that grow on decaying food or
vegetable matter.<br>
<img src="iimagewow/img50.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
<br>
4.3.4 Vegetative propagation<br><br>
Vegetative propagation is a method of asexual reproduction in plants
where structures with lateral meristems such as roots, stems, buds,
and leaves give rise to new self-supporting individual. The following
are types of vegetative reproduction.<br>
Runners originate from auxiliary bud in a lower portion of plant
and grow along the surface of the soil. In the cultivated strawberry,
for example, leaves, flowers, and roots are produced at every other
node on the runner. Just beyond each second node, the tip of the
runner turns up and becomes thickened. This thickened portion
produces first adventitious roots and then a new shoot that continues
the runner. Thus a complete plant may develop and take root at the
node, nourished for a time by food sent from the parent plant through
the stolon. Eventually, the stolon dries up and withers, leaving an
independent daughter plant growing a short distance away from the
parent.<br>
In many plants, horizontal shoots arise from lateral buds near the
stem base and grow under the ground. Such underground horizontal
stems are called rhizomes. At the nodes of the rhizome are buds, which
may develop to produce shoots above the ground. The shoots become
independent plants when the connecting rhizome dies. Many grasses
propagate by rhizomes; the couch grass is a good example.<br>
<img src="iimagewow/img51.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
Corms are similar to rhizomes, except they are more rounded and
fleshy (such as in gladiolus). Corms contain stored food that enables
some plants to survive the winter.<br>
Tubers are modified stems that may store starch, as seen in the potato
(Solanum sp.). Tubers arise as swollen ends of stolons, and contain
many adventitious or unusual buds. If the tubers are left in the ground
or transplanted, the buds will produce shoots, using food stored in the
tuber.<br>
A bulb, which functions as an underground storage unit, is a modification of a stem that has the appearance of enlarged fleshy leaves
emerging from the stem or surrounding the base of the stem.<br>
<img src="iimagewow/img52.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
<br>
4.3.5 Parthenogenesis<br><br>
Some species of animals (e.g., bees) are able to reproduce asexually.
Among common honeybees (Apis mellifera), a queen bee might lay
2,000 eggs per day. Nearly all of these eggs are fertilized by sperm the
queen has received during one of her nuptial fights, and each one
of these eggs will develop into one of the worker bees of the colony
every one of them a female. A queen can, however, choose to let
some of her eggs go unfertilized; no sperm from a male ever fuses
with these eggs, yet bees develop within them and hatch from them.
Since egg and sperm do not come together in this process, this is not
sexual reproduction. Instead, each of these bees has been derived
through parthenogenesis: a form of asexual reproduction in which
an unfertilized egg develops into an adult organism. Among the
honeybees, all the bees derived through parthenogenesis are males
these are the few drones of a bee colony.<br><br>
4.4 <u>Sexual reproduction in Humans</u><br><br>
Sexual reproduction involves the production of sex cells. It almost
always involves two parent organisms. These sex cells are called
gametes and they are made in reproductive organs. The gametes are
produced through meiosis. Sexual reproduction starts with the union
of sperm and an egg in a process called fertilization. This can occur
either inside (internal fertilization) or outside (external fertilization)
the body of the female. Fertilization results in the formation of a single
cell called a zygote. The zygote then grows into a new individual. The
female gametes are always larger than the male gametes and are not
mobile.<br>
The human males are born with the penis, scrotum and testicle
whereas females are born with vagina, uterus, and ovaries. These are
the primary sexual characteristics in males and females, respectively.
At puberty or adolescence these characteristics change markedly.<br>
Puberty begins in the early teen years. Puberty or adolescence
is the time when secondary sex characteristics begin to develop.
Secondary sexual characteristics begin to develop so that sexual 
maturity is reached. Sexual maturity means that the potential for
sexual reproduction exists. Secondary sexual characteristics in males
include:<br>
1.growth and maintenance of the male sex organs,<br>
2.an increase in body hair, an increase in muscle mass,<br>
3.increased growth of the long bones of the arms and legs, and<br>
4.deepening of the voice.<br>
The glands of the endocrine system release hormones which control
the development and activity of the male reproductive system. The
changes that occur during puberty are controlled by sex hormones.
These hormones are secreted by the endocrine system. The onset of
puberty in males causes the hypothalamus to produce several kinds of
hormones. These hormones interact with the pituitary gland.<br>
The hypothalamus secretes a hormone that causes the pituitary gland
to release two other hormones. The hormones are follicle-stimulating
hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). When FSH and
LH are released into the bloodstream, are carried to the testes. In
the testes, FSH causes the production of sperm cells. LH causes the
endocrine cells that are in the testes to produce the male hormone
testosterone. Testosterone influences the production of sperm cells.
Testosterone is responsible for the growth and development of
secondary sex characteristics in the male. The FSH and LH are also
secreted in females and influence the development of secondary sex
characteristics.<br>
Puberty in females begins in the early teen years. In females, LH
causes eggs to be released into the oviduct whereas FSH stimulates the
development of follicles in the ovary. A follicle is a group of epithelial
cells. These epithelial cells surround a developing egg cell. FSH also
causes a hormone called estrogen to be released from the ovary. It is
responsible for the secondary sex characteristics of females. Secondary
sexual characteristics in females include:<br>
1.Increase in growth rates of the long bones of the arms and legs.<br>
2.Develop more hair, especially under the arms and in the pubic
area.<br>
3.The hips broaden, and more fat is deposited in the breasts,
buttocks, and thighs.<br>
4.The menstrual cycle begins.<br>
Young people must adjust to remarkable physiological, anatomical,
and psychological transformations during the process of puberty.
Their bodies change rapidly, and thus their body image also changes.
Any deviations of their bodies from what they or their peers consider
ï¿½normalï¿½ can lead to low self-esteem. For example, females will worry
about the size of their breasts and other aspects of their figures and
will not feel feminine if these are not in line with the norm of their
peers. Similarly, a male may worry about the size of his penis or
his physique; and if these are not within the norm, he will feel that
something is wrong with him. Young people should realize that there
is considerable variation in the timing of the stages of puberty among
different individuals, and that most people develop into ï¿½normalï¿½
adults in the course of their sexual and physical maturation.<br>
An individual who reaches puberty later or earlier than his or her peers
can suffer psychological pain. If not handled in a constructive fashion,
early or late puberty can lead to poor self-esteem and problems in
sexual and other areas of life. For example, late-developing males may
suffer from a poor self-image, and this can influence them in later
life. They tend to have a lower occupational attainment, get paid less,
marry later, and have fewer children than other men of the same adult
height. Early maturing males, on the other hand, can have an easier
time of it. They tend to be held in higher esteem by their peers because
of their broad shoulders and masculine physiques. Early-maturing
females suffer more than early-maturing males. Because of their
mature bodies (large breasts), their peers make the assumption that
they are sexually experienced and sexually ï¿½easy,ï¿½ whereas in actuality,
early maturing females tend to be submissive, socially indifferent, and
low in popularity. Therefore, such individual should get medical or
psychological advice to cope up with problems related early or late
puberty.<br>
Adolescence is the period between puberty and adulthood, when a
good deal of social learning takes place. The length of this period of
youth is socially determined. Its length could be influenced by nature,
culture, and civilization. Biologically, teenagers are adult after they
have reached puberty, when they are capable of having children.
Economically, they are adult when they can support themselves and
possibly a family. Morally, they are adult when they are responsible
for their actions, can express love in a mature manner, and can
have productive and meaningful relationships. During adolescence,
teenagers must achieve economic and moral adulthood; deal with
separation from family.<br><br>
4.5 <u>Male reproductive structures</u><br><br>
The male reproductive system of vertebrates, such as that of human
males includes testes, epididymis, vas deferens, accessory glands, and
a penis. Paired testes are the sites of sperm production. Each testis
is composed of numerous seminiferous tubules, in which the sperm
develop. The sperm are surrounded by cells, which nourish the
developing sperm. Between the tubules are cells which produce the
male sex hormone (testosterone). In most mammals, the two testes
are housed permanently in a sac-like scrotum suspended outside the
abdominal cavity. This odd arrangement provides an environment
of slightly lower temperature, since in most mammals (including
humans) viable sperm do not form at temperatures maintained within
the body.<br>
The sperm travels from the seminiferous tubules to epididymis, where
sperm maturation occurs and then to a vas deferens, the ejaculatory
duct. The vas deferens joins the urethra, a duct that carries both sperm
and urinary products through the penis. Three sets of accessory glands
open in to the reproductive channels: a pair of seminal vesicles, a
single prostate gland, and the pair of bulbourethral glands (Fig.4.8).
Fluid secreted by these glands furnishes food to the sperm, lubricates
the female reproductive tract for sperm, and counteracts the acidity
of the vagina so that the sperm retain their viability longer after being
deposited in the female. Semen is a mix of sperm, proteins, nutrients,
ions, and signalling molecules. Sperm constitute less than 5 percent of
semen volume.<br>
The sperm has a ï¿½headï¿½ that is packed full of genetic material and
covered by an enzyme. The enzymes help the sperm penetrate an egg.
At its other end, the sperm has a flagellum that it uses to swim toward
an egg. In the midsection contains many mitochondria that supply
the energy required for flagellar movement.<br>

Epididymides: a pair of ducts in which sperm formed in testes
mature; each empties into a vas deferens.<br>
Penis: male organ of intercourse.<br>
Prostate gland: produces alkaline secretions that help raise the
pH of the female reproductive tract, making this passage more
hospitable to sperm.<br>
Scrotum: pouch of skin that encloses a human maleï¿½s testes.<br>
Semen: sperm mixed with secretions from seminal vesicles and the
prostate gland.<br>
Seminal vesicles: are exocrine glands which secrete fructose-rich

male germ cells and produce sperm.<br>
Testosterone: main hormone produced by testes; required for sperm
production and development of male secondary sexual traits.<br>
Vas deferens: one of a pair of long ducts that convey mature sperm
toward the body surface.<br><br>
4.6 <u>Female reproductive structures</u><br><br>
A human femaleï¿½s gonadsï¿½her ovariesï¿½lie deep inside her pelvic
cavity. They produce and release egg. They also secrete estrogens and
progesterone, the main sex hormones in females. Estrogens trigger
development of female secondary sexual characteristics and maintain
the lining of there productive tract. Progesterone thickens the lining
of the reproductive tract in preparation for pregnancy.
Adjacent to each ovary is an oviduct, a hollow tube that connects the
ovary to the uterus. Both oviducts open onto the uterus, a hollow, pear
shaped organ. The uterine lining consists of glandular epithelium,
connective tissues, and blood vessels. The bottom of the uterus, a
narrowed region called the cervix, opens into the vagina. The vagina,
which extends from the cervix to the bodyï¿½s surface, is the organ of
intercourse and the birth canal.
Externally visible organs of the reproductive tract are called genitals.
Female genitals include two pairs of liplike skin folds that enclose the
openings of the vagina and urethra. Adipose tissue fills the thick outer
folds, the labia majora. Thin inner folds are the labia minora. The
clitoris lies near the anterior junction of the labia minora. It contains
erectile tissue and is highly sensitive to tactile stimulation. The
opening into the vagina is often reduced in size in the virgin state by
a membrane, the hymen, although in todayï¿½s more physically active
females, this membrane may be much reduced in extent.
The paired ovaries of the human female, contain many thousands of
eggs. During a womanï¿½s fertile years, except following fertilization,
approximately 13 eggs mature each year, and usually the ovaries
alternate in releasing eggs. Because a woman is fertile for only about
30 years, of the approximately 400,000 eggs in her ovaries at birth,
only 300 to 400 have a chance to reach maturity; the others degenerate.
The uterine tubes or oviducts are lined with cilia for propelling the egg
away from the ovary from which it was released. The two ducts open
into the upper corners of the uterus, or womb, which is specialized
for housing the embryo during its intrauterine existence. It consists
of thick muscular walls, many blood vessels, and a specialized lining:
the endometrium. The uterus is designed to hold more than one
developing embryo.<br>
In humans, egg production occurs before birth. A girl is born with
about 2 million eggs. At puberty hormonal changes prompt eggs to
mature, one at a time, in an approximately twenty eight- day ovarian
cycle. As the cycle begins, the follicle enlarges and a fluid filled cavity
forms around it. About two weeks after the follicle began to mature, its
wall ruptures and ovulation occurs. The egg and surrounding follicle
cells are ejected into the adjacent oviduct. After ovulation, cells of the
ruptured follicle develop into a hormone-secreting corpus luteum. If
pregnancy does not occur, the corpus luteum breaks down, and a new
follicle will begin to mature.<br>
<img src="iimagewow/img54.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
<br>
4.7 <u>The Menstrual cycle</u><br><br>
The ovarian cycle described in the previous section is coordinated
with cyclic changes in the uterus. We refer to the approximately
monthly changes in the uterus as the menstrual cycle. The first day of
the menstrual cycle is marked by onset of menstruation, which is the
flow of bits of uterine lining and some blood from the uterus, through
the cervix, and out of the vagina.
FSH stimulates maturation of an ovarian follicle. The interval of
follicle maturation before ovulation is the follicular phase of the cycle.
During this time, cells around the egg secrete estrogens that stimulate
the endometrium to thicken. The rise in estrogens encourages the
pituitary to release more LH. The flow of LH causes the follicle to
swell and burst. LH trigger for ovulation. The luteal phase of the cycle
begins after ovulation. LH stimulates formation of the corpus luteum,
which secretes some estrogens and a lot of progesterone. These
hormones cause the uterine lining to thicken and encourage blood
vessels to grow through it. The uterus is now ready for pregnancy.
A woman enters menopause when all the follicles in her ovaries have
either been released during menstrual cycles or have disintegrated
as a result of aging. With no follicles left to mature, production of
estrogen and progesterone is diminished and menstrual cycles cease.
Menopause is known only in humans and two species of whales.<br><br>
4.8 <u>Sexually transmitted infections (STIs): Transmission and prevention</u><br><br>
<u>Trichomoniasis</u><br>
It is caused by the flagellated protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis. Many
infected people do not have symptoms, but some infected women
have a yellowish discharge, and a sore, itchy vagina. In both sexes, an
untreated infection can cause infertility. Some epidemiological studies
suggest that, in men, untreated trichomoniasis may increase the risk
of benign prostate enlargement and aggressive prostate cancer. A
single dose of an antiprotozoal drug can quickly cure the infection.
Both partners should be treated.<br>
<u>Chlamydia</u><br>
It is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Chlamydias are small bacteria.
In women, an infection of the reproductive tract by bacteria most
often goes undetected. Some women and most men experience
painful urination; most infected men have a clear or yellow discharge
from the penis. Left untreated, a Chlamydia infection can scar the
reproductive tract and lead to infertility in both sexes. An infection
can be passed from a mother to child during birth, causing pneumonia
and conjunctivitis in the newborn. Chlamydia can be cured with
antibiotics.<br>
<u>Gonorrhea</u><br>
Is the second most common bacterial STI is caused by Neisseria
gonorrhoeae. Men usually develop symptoms within one week of
becoming infected; yellow pus oozes from the penis and urination
becomes frequent and painful. By contrast, most women have no
early symptoms. In both sexes an infection can damage reproductive
ducts and cause sterility. Gonorrhea is treated with antibiotics, but strains resistant to the most widely used antibiotics are increasingly
common. Gonorrhea could harms the joints and skin, but can also
affect the heart and liver.<br>
<u>Syphilis</u><br>
Is caused by Treponema pallidum, a spiral shaped bacterium. During
sex with an infected partner, these bacteria get onto the genitals or into
the cervix, vagina, or oral cavity. They slip into the body through tiny
cuts. If untreated, the infection can become systemic. Skin chancres
appear and the liver, bones, and eventually the brain can be damaged.
Like gonorrhea, syphilis is treated with antibiotics.<br>
<u>HIV/AIDS</u><br>
The disease is now known as Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or
HIV. HIV kills immune cells in the body. HIV leads to Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome, or AIDS. Once attached, the virus can
penetrate the immune cell. The virus may remain inactive for months.<br>
<u>Spread of HIV</u><br>
The disease HIV is spread from an infected person through blood
or body fluids. This can occur through direct contact with the
infected blood or body fluids. It also can occur through contact
with objects that have been contaminated by infected blood or body
fluids. Intimate sexual contact and use of contaminated intravenous
needles are known methods of disease transmission. HIV also can
be transmitted by blood transfusion if the blood is contaminated. A
pregnant woman who has HIV can transmit it to her fetus. The virus
also can be transmitted through breast milk.<br>
<i><u>What are the symptoms of AIDS?</u></i><br>
The first symptoms of AIDS may not appear for as many as ten years
after a person is infected. During this time, the AIDS virus reproduces,
infecting more and more immune cells. People infected with HIV may
develop AIDS. Early symptoms of AIDS may include swollen lymph
nodes, loss of appetite, weight loss, fever, rashes, night sweats, and
fatigue. It is not known how many people who are infected with HIV
will develop AIDS. AIDS weakens the bodyï¿½s immune system and
the body cannot fight off other infectious diseases or certain forms of
cancer.<br>
<u>Prevention and control of HIV</u><br>
Abstinence from intimate sexual contact protects against HIV
and other sexually transmitted diseases. HIV transmission can be
prevented among users of illegal drugs if they do not share needles.
When AIDS first appeared, there were no effective drugs. Today, there is a range of drugs that can be given separately or as a ï¿½cocktailï¿½, which
slow the progress of the disease. Research to find a vaccine and more
effective drugs is ongoing. There is a range of blood tests designed to
detect HIV infection. These tests do not detect the virus but do indicate
whether antibodies to the virus are in the blood. If HIV antibodies are
present, the person is said to be HIV positive. The tests vary in their
reliability and some are too expensive for widespread use.

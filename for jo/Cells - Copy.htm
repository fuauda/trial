3.1 <u>What is a cell?</u><br><br>
Cell is the smallest and the basic unit of living things. All living things
are composed of cells. Some of these living things consist of a single
cell and are called unicellular organisms.
For example, paramecium is a unicellular organism. Most of the
unicellular organisms are invisible with naked eyes, but there are
some exceptions like chicken egg cells which can be seen with naked
eyes. The other groups of living things such as plants and animals
including humans which consist of many cells are called multicellular
organisms. The body of multicellular organisms is composed of many
cells of specialized types which work cooperatively. For example, in the case of human body, everything you do, every action and every
thought are possible because of the processes that occur at the cellular
level. Each activity of our body is a result of the cooperative work of
muscle cells for movement, nerve cells for gathering information and
brain cell for interpretation of message to action.<br>
Most cells are very small and are, therefore, visible only with a
microscope but an ostrich egg is a single cell with about 6 inches in
diameter and weighing about 1.36kg; nerve cells in your body can
stretch several feet long, and nerve cells in giant squid can be more
than 30 feet long!<br><br>
3.2 <u>Cell theory</u><br><br>
An English scientist, Robert Hooke was the first to observe cells and
to use the word cell for structures in living organisms. He did this
in 1665 after examining thin slices of plant material cork. He was
surprised by the regular appearance of the structure, which is ‘pore
like’ regular structures that Hooke called ‘cells’. Each cell appeared to
be an empty box surrounded by a wall. Hooke had discovered and
described a cell, without realizing that it is the fundamental unit of all
living things.
After Hooke discovered cells in the first half of the seventh century,
other early Dutch Microbiologist Anton van Leeuwenhoek (1632—
1723) used his lenses in building numerous microscopes, some with
magnifications approaching 300X. In 1674 he likely observed protozoa
for the first time and several years’ later he observed bacteria. Those
“very little animalcules” he was able to isolate from different sources,
such as rainwater, pond and well water, and the human mouth and
intestine. Leeuwenhoek is universally acknowledged as the father of
microbiology because, he discovered microorganisms like protists
and bacteria.
More than 150 years later, German scientists, Matthias Schleiden and
Theodor Schwann were the first to explain the basic views of what we
now call cell theory.
In 1838, German botanist Matthias Schleiden, a botanist stated that all plants are made up of cells, and a year in 1839, another German
zoologist Theodor Schwann reported that all animals are made up of
cells. The two German biologists, established cells as the natural unit
and function in living things, the entire animals and plants are made
up of these cells. Then a German pathologist, Rudolf Virchow (1856)
established the idea that cells arise only by the division of existing
cells. Based on the above discoveries, the principle of cell theory is
developed. The cell theory states that:<br>
1. Living organisms are composed of one or more cells.<br>
2. Cells are the smallest unit of life.<br>
3. Cells arise only by the division of a pre-existing cell.<br>
Cells vary considerably in size and shape but they share certain
common features:<br>
• Every living cell is surrounded by a membrane, which separates
the cell contents from everything else outside.<br>
• Cells contain genetic material which stores all of the instructions
needed for the cell’s activities. Many of these activities are chemical
reactions, catalyzed by enzymes produced inside the cell.<br>
• Cells have their own energy release system that powers all of the
cell’s activities, So cells can be thought of as the smallest living
structures – nothing smaller can survive.<br><br>
3.3 <u>Cell structure and function</u><br><br>
Cells have different structures which have different functions.
The organization of cells varies between different organisms. In
multicellular organisms, some cells have the same shape and same
function but other cells have different shapes and different functions.
For example, in the human body, the shape and function of nerve
cells are different from that of muscle cells.<br>

<br>
Cells look like one another in certain important ways. One important
similarity between plant and animal cells is the presence of common
cell structures. The major structures these cells have in common are:<br>
1.Nucleus<br>
2.Cytoplasm, and<br>
3.Cell (plasma) membrane.<br>
<img src="img34.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
Cell wall is a rigid structure of a plant cell that provides structural
support and gives shape to the cell. It is found external to the cell
membrane. Fungal cells, some Protista cells such as algae and bacterial
cells also have cell walls. Animal cells have no cell wall.<br>
Cell membrane is an outer covering that separates the cell’s interior
from its surrounding environment. Cell membrane is a very thin
selectively permeable structure. Cell membrane controls what enters
into and leaves a cell. It controls the entry of organic molecules, ions,
water, and oxygen into and out of a cell. Wastes, such as carbon dioxide
also leave a cell by passing through a cell membrane.<br>
Cytoplasm is a thick fluid-filled region in the cell containing cell
organelles. The fluid material of the cytoplasm consists of 70 to 80
percent water with different organic (proteins, carbohydrates) and
inorganic (ions such as sodium, potassium, calcium) molecules dissolved in it. It is also the site where several chemical reactions such
as protein synthesis take place.<br>
Nucleus is the largest organelle surrounded by the double-membrane.
Inside a nucleus, there are thread-like structures called chromosomes
that contain a very long molecule of DNA ( Deoxyribonucleic acid).
The nucleus determines what the cell will be, for example, a blood cell,
a liver cell, a muscle cell or a nerve cell. The nucleus also controls cell
division. Within a nucleus there is a darker area called the nucleolus,
this is the site where new ribosomes are made. Most cells contain one
nucleus but there are
interesting exceptions.
For example, both the
mature red blood cells of
mammals and the sieve tube
elements of the phloem of
flowering plants are without
a nucleus. Both lose their
nucleus as they mature. The
individual cylindrical fibers
of voluntary muscle consist
of a multinucleate sack.
Fungal mycelia also contain
multinucleate cytoplasm.<br>
Ribosomes are small cellular structures that are found in large numbers
in all cells. The function of ribosomes is to synthesize proteins. They
are found either freely in the cytoplasm or attached to the rough
endoplasmic reticulum.<br>
The endoplasmic reticulum is a complex system of interconnected
double membranes. They contain fluid-filled spaces between the
membranes which allow materials to be transported throughout the
cell. There are two distinct types of the endoplasmic reticulum.<br>
Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum gets its name from the dotted appearance of its surface. These
dotted structures on it are the ribosomes. Proteins can be made
by these ribosomes. Proteins can be made and stored in the rough
endoplasmic reticulum and transported around the cell in the small
sacs called vesicles.<br>
Smooth endoplasmic reticulum is endoplasmic reticulum without ribosomes. It is important in
the manufacturing of lipids.<br>
<img src="img35.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
Vesicles are a small stack-like collection of the membranous sac. They
store and transport and ship materials where they need to go. For
example, a protein made by the rough endoplasmic reticulum may
be placed inside a transport vesicle and shipped to the Golgi bodies,
where it would be modified and tagged for shipment elsewhere. These
vesicles are found in the cell by fusing with the Golgi apparatus.<br>
Golgi apparatus is a smooth, concave, membranous structure.
The Golgi apparatus with the vesicles functions in the collection,
packaging, and distribution of molecules within the cell or even
outside the cell.
Proteins and lipids manufactured on the rough and smooth
endoplasmic reticulum are transported into the Golgi apparatus and
modified as they pass through it. These modified proteins and lipids
are then packaged into vesicles that pinch off from the Golgi apparatus.
These vesicles then diffuse to other locations in the cell, distributing
the newly synthesized molecules to their appropriate place.<br>
Golgi apparatus is an
organelle named by its
discoverer (Italian scientist
Camillo Golgi),who first
described this structure in
1898.
You can think of the Golgi
apparatus as a detailing
facility that receives ship
newly manufactured cars
(proteins), puts on the
finishing touches, stores
the completed cars, and
then ships them out when
needed. Products made
in the ER reach the Golgi
apparatus in transport
vesicles.<br>
Mitochondria are relatively large organelles found in the cells. It has
a double membrane; the outer one controls the entry and exit of
materials. The inner membrane forms many folds on which some of
the chemical reactions of respiration take place and the site for the
synthesis of much energy. Mitochondria are often described as the
‘powerhouse’ of the cell since they are the sites of respiration.<br>
<img src="img36.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
Lysosomes are little membrane-bound packages of digestive enzymes.
They contain digestive enzymes which can be used to digest bacteria
or other cells taken into the cell. It is also break down unwanted or
damaged organelles within the cell.<br>
<img src="img37.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
Lysosomes are involved
in the breakdown of the
contents of ‘food’ vacuoles.
For example, harmful
bacteria. Any foreign matter
or food particles are taken
up into these vacuoles is
then broken down by the
digestive enzymes. This
occurs when lysosomes fuse
with the vacuole.
Lysosomes also destroy
damaged organelles in this
way.
Phagocytosis came from two
Greek words phagein which
means to eat, and kytos is
vessel referring here to the
cell.<br>
Vacuoles are organelles that consist simply of a single membrane with
fluid inside. Many plant cells have large vacuoles that occupy more
than half of the cell volume. Vacuoles are small in the case of animal
cell. Vacuoles perform a variety of functions in different kinds of cells.
Food vacuole found in some animals to digest food and in the case
of some unicellular organisms there is a contractile vacuole which is
function is to expel excess water. For example, amoebas and many
other unicellular eukaryotes have food vacuole in order to eat smaller
organisms or food particles, by a process called phagocytosis. Many
unicellular protists living in fresh water have contractile vacuoles
that pump excess water out of the cell, thereby keeping a suitable
concentration of ions and molecules inside the cell.<br>
Chloroplasts are also double membrane-bounded organelles that
occur in the cell of green plants, mostly in the cells of the leaves. They
are the site for photosynthesis. They contain a green pigment called
chlorophyll that can trap the sunlight energy for T=the synthesis of
carbohydrates.<br>
The cytoplasm of cells consists of small cylindrical fibers called
microtubules that have a variety of roles, including moving
chromosomes during cell division. In addition, animal cells have
structures called centrioles that anchor to microtubules during cell
division.<br>
Cilia and flagella are the most common organelles for locomotion in
unicellular organisms.
Cilia are short, hair-like structures. Cilia are used for locomotion. It
can also be used to create a current in the fluid next to the cell. For
example, cilia occur in large numbers on the lining (epithelium) of
the air tubes serving the lungs (bronchi).
Flagella are long, thread-like structures, present in lesser number.
Flagellum extends from the plasma membrane and enables an entire
cell to move. When present, the cell has just one flagellum or a few
flagella. When present, cilia are smaller and many.<br>
<img src="img38.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
<br>
3.4 <u>Types of cells</u><br><br>
Based on cell structure and cellular organization, cells are grouped
into two types. These are Prokaryotic cells and Eukaryotic cells.
Prokaryotic cells are usually much smaller than eukaryotic cells. They
have a much simpler structure and are thought to be the first cells
to have evolved. Prokaryotic cells such as bacterial cells don’t have
membrane-bound organelles or a nucleus. Eukaryotes such as plants
and animals cells, in contrast, have membrane-bound organelles and
a nucleus.<br>
Prokaryotes are different from eukaryotic cells because of the
absence of a nucleus and other membrane-bounded organelles.
These Prokaryotic cells are generally much smaller than eukaryotic
cells. Most prokaryotic organisms are unicellular. The cell wall acts
as an extra layer of protection, helps the cell maintain its shape, and
prevents dehydration.<br>
Unlike prokaryotes, eukaryotes have a nucleus and other membranebound organelles. For example, each organ in an animal’s body is
specialized to perform a particular role, each organelle in a eukaryotic
cell has a distinctive structure and function. Prokaryotic organisms
are unicellular but eukaryotic organisms are usually multicellular.<br>
The term Eukaryotic is derived from the Greek eu, true, and karyon, kernel, referring to the nucleus.
Thus Eukaryotic cells are cells with a “true nucleus”.
Similarly, the term Prokaryotic is derived from the Greek pro means before and karyon means
nucleus; “before nucleus”, reflecting the earlier evolution of prokaryotic cells. Eukaryotic cells are
usually between 10 and 100 micro meters (mm) wide, while prokaryotes are between 1 and 10 m.<br>
<img src="img39.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
<br>
3.5 <u>Animal and plant cells</u><br><br>
Animal and plant cells have certain features in common like cell
membrane, nucleus, cytoplasm, and organelles like mitochondria,
and Golgi apparatus. The animal and plant cell structures have
also some differences. For example, cell wall, chloroplast and large permanent vacuoles are found in plant cells while centriole is found
only in animal cells.
In addition, plant cells are usually larger and are more easily visible
under alight microscope than animal cells. The plant vacuole is
surrounded by a membrane and contains fluid. The fluid in the
vacuole is a solution of pigments, enzymes, sugars and other organic
compounds (including some waste products), mineral salts, oxygen
and carbon dioxide. Vacuoles help to regulate the osmotic properties
of cells (the flow of water inwards and outwards). Chloroplasts are
found in the green parts of the plant, mainly in the leaves.<br><br>
3.6 <u>The cell and its environment</u><br><br>
Cells need food materials to get energy or to build up its cell structures.
Cells also need salts and water, which play a part in chemical reactions
in the cell. Cells also need to remove unnecessary substances such as
carbon dioxide.
The structure of a cell known as cell membrane is semi-permeable,
it controls the entering of necessary substances and the removal of
unnecessary ones. Materials can pass through the cell membrane either
passively by diffusion and osmosis or actively by active transport.<br>
Passive transport is the movement of substances down a concentration
gradient. This movement is from an area of high concentration to an
area of lower concentrate on with-out the need for input of energy.<br>
You can think of passive and active transport like rolling a ball on
a hill. Imagine that the hill is made of molecules; the lower part
of the hill has few molecules, while the upper part of the hill has
lots of stacked molecules. If you want to roll a ball downhill (or let
molecules flow from where they’re piled up to where they’re not),
you don’t have to use any energy. If you want to roll the ball uphill
(or push molecules from where they’re in low concentration to where
they’re in high concentration), you have to put in some energy.<br>
Diffusion is the movement of molecules from a region of high concentration
to a region of low concentration down the concentration gradient.
Diffusion is a passive transport of molecules; the molecules need
only spread themselves, or diffuse, across the membrane. The
diffusion of gases and solutes is important for any activity of the cell.
For example, oxygen is important for respiration and get into the cell
by diffusion.<br>
<img src="img40.png" height="800" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
Factors influencing the rate of diffusion:<br>
Concentration gradient: the higher the difference in the
concentration of a substance on either side of a membrane, the
faster it will tend to diffuse from higher concentration to lower.<br>
Temperature: increase in temperature causes an increase in the
kinetic energy that molecules and ions possess enabling them to
move faster.<br>
Mass of the molecule: heavier molecules move more slowly;
therefore, they diffuse more slowly while lighter molecules diffuse
faster.<br>
Distance travelled: the farther the distance that a substance must
travel, the slower the diffusion rate.<br>
Surface area: The greater the surface area, the faster the total
diffusion is . Cells that are involved in rapid absorption, such as those
in the kidney or the intestine, often have their ‘free’ surface membrane
formed into hundreds of tiny projections called microvilli which
increase the absorbing surface.<br>
Osmosis is a special case of diffusion. Like other substances water can
also move passively through cell membrane. It moves from a region
of high concentration of water molecules (lower solute concentration)
to a region of lower concentration of water molecules (higher solute
concentration). 
The movement of water is affected by the concentration of substances
(solutes) dissolved in the water. Basically, water moves from areas
where there is more water to areas where there is less water.<br>
<img src="img41.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
The movement of water into and out of the cell depends on the type of
solution found in the cell surrounding (Environment found outside
the cell).
When a cell is in a hypertonic solution, water moves out of the cell,
causing the cell to shrink or plasmolysed. In an isotonic solution,
water diffuses into and out of the cell at the same rate, with no change
in cell size. In a hypotonic solution, water moves into the cell and
pressure are applied to the plasma membrane causing turgidity of
the cell. The strong cell wall of plant cells can resist this pressure to
keep the cell from rupturing. This is not the case with animal cells as
animal cells lack cell wall.<br>
<u>Osmosis in Plant cells</u><br>
Osmosis in plants is very important to bring strength and rigidity to
the plant cell. If a plant cell is surrounded by water or a solution more
dilute than its contents (hypotonic solution), water will pass into the
vacuole of the plant. The vacuole will expand and press outwards
on the cytoplasm and cell wall. Then, the rigid cell wall expands
and exert the pressure back, preventing the cell from taking in too
much water and bursting. The plant becomes very turgid, due to the
pressure of water pressing outwards on the cell wall.
Turgor pressure is necessary for plants to retain their upright
posture and the extended state of their leaves. In contrast, if a plant
cell is surrounded by water or a solution less dilute than its contents
(hypertonic solution), plant cells lose water and there will no longer
be any water pressure pressing outwards against the cell walls, the
plasma membrane shrinks pulls away from the cell and the cell get
plasmolysed. The plasmolysed cell wilts and eventually dies.
If the water concentration of the
solution surrounding the plant cell is too high, the cell swells and
turgid. If it is the concentration water in both is the same. If the
solution surrounding the cell is too high, the plant cell plasmoly.<br>
Without adequate water, the plant on the left has lost turgor pressure,
visible in its wilting. Watering the plant (right) will restore the turgor
pressure.<br>
<u>Osmosis in Animal Cells</u><br>
The excessive uptake or loss of water by animal cells causes damages
to cells. The survival of an animal cell, thus, depends on its ability to
balance water uptake and loss.
In the case of animals particularly vertebrates, the concentration
of water in the blood is monitored by the brain and adjusted by
the kidneys. The regulation of water flow is by keeping the blood
concentration within narrow limits, the concentration of the tissue
fluid remains more or less constant.
The animal cell should be surrounded by fluid or blood plasma which
has the same concentration of water as the cell contents; there is no
net flow of water into or out of the cells. If not balanced, osmosis
can cause a serious problem in the animal cell. For Example, if the
surrounding solution has a high concentration of water (hypotonic)
than the cells, water will move into the cells by osmosis.
Water entering the cell will make the cell swell up. Animal cells
have no cell wall and the membrane has little strength, water would
continue to enter and the cells will eventually burst. This process
is called hemolysis of the cell which can occur in red blood cells.
Conversely, if the surrounding solution has a low concentration of
water (hypertonic) than the cells, water will pass out of the cell by
osmosis and the cell will shrink.<br>
<img src="img43.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
<u>Osmosis in Amoeba</u><br>
Unicellular protozoans such as amoeba have contractile vacuoles.
Contractile vacuole are membranous structures which controls the
intracellular water balance by accumulating and expelling excess
water out of the cell, allowing cells to survive under hypotonic stress
as in pond water participate in osmoregulation of the cell and prevent
the bursting of cells.
The unicellular protozoans which dwell in freshwater consume excess
water, with the help of contractile vacuoles they drain excess water
out. It also helps them to protect the cell in the absence of cell wall.
Without these vacuoles, they might take in too much water, swell and
burst out.<br>
Active transport is the movement of molecules from areas where
they’re less concentrated to areas where they’re more concentrated
using energy. Active transport enables cells to use their stored energy
to concentrate molecules inside or outside of the cell.
Active transport enables cells to use their stored energy to concentrate
molecules inside or outside of the cell. Active Transport is the
movement of particles through a cell membrane from a region of
lower concentration to a region of higher concentration against a
concentration gradient, using the energy released during respiration.
Cells sometimes take in substances even though there is already a higher
concentration inside than outside. The substance is absorbed against
the concentration gradient. Less commonly, cells sometimes pump
substances out, even though there is already a larger concentration
outside. Some of the examples are: ion uptake by root hairs and
uptake of glucose by epithelial cells of villi.<br>
Active transport allows
cells to maintain internal
concentrations of
small solutes that differ
from environmental
concentrations. For
example, compared with
its surroundings, an animal
nerve cell has a much higher
concentration of potassium
ions and a much lower
concentration of sodium
ions. The plasma membrane
helps maintain these
differences by pumping
sodium out of the cell and
potassium into the cell.
This particular case of
active transport (called the
sodium-potassium pump) is
vital to the nervous system
of most animals.<br>

<br>
3.7. <u>Levels of Biological Organization</u><br><br>
Life forms a hierarchy of organization from atoms to complex
multicellular organisms. Atoms are joined together to form molecules,
which are assembled into more complex structures such as organelles.
These in turn form subsystems that provide different functions. Cells
can be organized into tissues, then into organs and organ systems
such as the nervous system. This organization then extends beyond
individual organisms to populations, communities, ecosystems, and
finally the biosphere.<br>
The organization of the biological world is hierarchical—that is, each
level builds on the level below it:<br>
The cellular level. At the cellular level, atoms, the fundamental
elements of matter, are joined by s chemical bond into clusters called
molecules. Complex biological molecules are assembled into tiny
structures called organelles within membrane-bounded units we call
cells.<br>
Most cells, when they have finished dividing and growing, become
specialized. When cells are specialized, they do one particular job,
they develop a distinct shape and special kinds of chemical changes
take place in their cytoplasm.<br>
The organism level. Cells in complex multicellular organisms exhibit
three levels of an organization. The most basic level is that of tissues
(for example nerve tissue), which are groups of similar cells that act
as a functional unit. The cells of each type have a similar structure
and function so that the tissue itself can be said to have a particular
function; for example, muscles contract to cause movement, xylem
carries water in plants. The tissues of the leaf include the epidermis,
palisade tissue, spongy tissue, xylem and phloem.<br>
Tissues, in turn, are grouped into organs body structures composed
of several different tissues that act as structural and functional units.
For example, your brain is an organ composed of nerve cells. Organs
consist of several tissues grouped to make a structure with a special
function.<br>
For example, the stomach is an organ that contains tissues made from
epithelial cells, gland cells and muscle cells. These cells are supplied
with food and oxygen brought by blood vessels. The heart, lungs, intestines, brain and eyes are further examples of organs in animals.
In flowering plants, the root, stem and leaves are the organs.<br>
At the third level of organization, organs are grouped into systems.
The digestive system, for example, consists of digestive organs like
the stomach and intestine. The different systems collectively form an
organism. An organism is formed by the organs and systems working
together to produce an independent plant or animal.<br>

2.1 <u>Characteristics of living things</u><br><br>
Living things have variety of shapes and forms. Thus, biologists study
life in many different ways. Biologists often live with wildlife, collect
fossils, or listen to whales. For example, they count how many times
a hummingbird�s wings beat per second. What makes something
�alive�? Anyone could deduce that a galloping horse is alive and a car
is not, but why? We cannot say, �If it moves, it�s alive� because a car
can move, and gelatin can wiggle in a bowl. They certainly are not
alive. Although we cannot define life with a single sentence, we can
come up with a series of characteristics shared by living systems.<br>

Some of the properties that are shared by all living things are listed
below:<br>
All living things are made up of one or more cells: Those made up of
one cell, such as bacteria are termed �unicellular� and those made up
of more than one cell, such as plants are termed �multi-cellular�<br>
All living things require energy: All organisms use a source of energy
for their metabolic activities. For example, every muscle in your body
is powered by the energy you obtain from your diet. Some organisms
use energy from the sunlight to make their foods through the process
of photosynthesis. Such organisms, for example plants, are known as
producers or autotrophs. Other organisms cannot make their own
food but consume others. Such organisms are known as consumers
or heterotrophs.<br>
All living organisms respond to stimuli: organisms can detect or
sense stimuli (change) in the internal or external environment and
make appropriate responses.<br>
All living things can grow: Growth is a permanent increase in size
and mass due to an increase in cell number or cell size or both.
Even bacteria and single-celled creatures show an increase in size.
Multicellular organisms which increase the number of cells in their
bodies become more complicated and change their shape and size.<br>
All living things can reproduce: Reproduction is the process that
makes more of the same kind of organism. Single-celled organisms
may simply keep dividing into two. However, multicellular plants and
animals may reproduce sexually or asexually.<br>
All living things can excrete: Excretion is the removal of the
metabolic wastes produced in cells as a result of chemical reactions
(metabolism). For example, respiration and other chemical reactions
in the cells produce waste products such as carbon dioxide. Living
organisms expel such substances from their bodies in various ways.<br>
All living things display ordered complexity: All living things
are both complex and highly ordered. The levels of organization in biological systems begin with atoms and molecules and increase in complexity. Your body is composed of many different kinds of cells
each containing many complex molecular structures. Many nonliving
things may also be complex, but they do not exhibit this degree of
ordered complexity.<br>
Most living things maintain homeostasis: Most organisms maintain
relatively constant internal conditions that are different from their
environment. Homeostasis is the regulation of an organism�s internal
conditions to maintain stability. For example, your body temperature
remains stable despite changes in outside temperatures.<br>
All living things possess adaptations that evolve overtime: All
organisms interact with other organisms and their environment in
ways that influence their survival, and as a result, organisms evolve
adaptations to their environments.<br><br>

2.2 <u>Taxonomy of living things</u><br><br>
2.2.1 <u> Principles of classification</u><br><br>
Organizing items not only makes them easier to find but can also
make them easier to understand. One tool biologists use to organize
and understand living organisms is classification. Classification is the
process of grouping things based on their similarities. The science of
naming, identifying and classifying organisms is known as taxonomy.
Scientists who study taxonomy are called taxonomists. Biologists
classify organisms into different categories mostly by judging the
degrees of their apparent similarities and differences. These include
the external and internal structures of the organism as well as where
the organism lives. Taxonomists also consider the genetic makeup
of organisms to reveal their evolutionary relationships to other
organisms. The assumption is that the greater the degree of physical similarity between them, the closer their biological relationship is.
They try to identify and classify organisms based on a number of
features (e.g., morphological, physiological, molecular, behavioural,
and/or ecological characters).<br><br>
2.2.2 <u>Taxonomic hierarchies in biological classification</u><br><br>
Thousands of years ago, the Greek philosopher Aristotle (384-322
BC) developed the first widely accepted biological classification
systems. He used simple morphological characters to classify plants
into trees, shrubs and herbs. He also divided animals into two groups
-those which had red blood and those that did not have. Though it
was useful for a while, Aristotle grouped some organisms that had
very little in common. For example, he grouped birds, bats, and flying
insects because they could fly. Later on in the 1700s, a Swedish Botanist
Carolus Linnaeus (1707�1778), who is also known as the father of
taxonomy, introduced a taxonomic hierarchy of classification. He was
the first person to propose an orderly system for classifying organisms.<br>
Taxonomic hierarchy is the process of arranging various organisms
into successive levels of the biological classification either in a
decreasing or an increasing order. In the Linnaean classification
system, all organisms are placed in a ranked hierarchy. The kingdom
is ranked the highest followed by Phylum (division), class, order,
family, genus, and species (Fig. 2.2). Each rank in a taxonomic
hierarchy is termed taxon (plural, taxa). Linnaeus� developed a two
Kingdom system of classification. He classified all living organisms
under kingdoms Plantae and Animalia that included all plants and
animals, respectively. This system did not distinguish between the
eukaryotes and prokaryotes, unicellular and multicellular organisms;
and photosynthetic (green algae) and non-photosynthetic (fungi)
organisms.<br>
On the broadest level, biologists divide the diversity of life into three
domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Every organism on Earth
belongs to one of these three domains. The first two domains, Bacteria
and Archaea, identify two very different groups of organisms that have
prokaryotic cells, relatively small and simple cells that lack a nucleus
or other compartments bounded by internal membranes. Eukaryotes have relatively large and complex cells that contain a nucleus and
other membrane-enclosed compartments. They are grouped into the
domain Eukarya. The domaineukarya includes groups such protists,
fungi, plants and animals. Domain is the rank above kingdom.<br>
<u>Key Terms</u><br>
Archaea: is a group of single-celled organisms that lack a nucleus but are more closely related to
eukaryotes than to bacteria.<br>
Bacteria: is the most diverse and well-known group of single-celled organisms that lack a nucleus.<br>
Classes: is a taxon of similar orders.<br>
Eukaryotic cells: are single-celled organisms with a nucleus.<br>
Family: is a taxon of similar genera.<br>
Genera: is a taxon of similar species.<br>
Kingdoms: is a taxon of similar phyla (plural for phylum).<br>
Orders: is a taxon of similar families.<br>
Phylum: is a taxon of similar classes. (Plant taxonomists use the taxon division instead of phylum).<br>
Prokaryotic cells: are unicellular organisms without a separate nucleus.<br>
Species: unique type of organism<br>
Taxon: is a group of organisms that share a unique setof traits<br>

<br><br>
2.3. <u>Relevance of classification</u><br><br>
Classification gives biologists a framework that allows them to study
the relationships between living (extant) and extinct organisms. For
example, this framework allows biologists to study the relationship
between birds and dinosaurs. Biologists have found that the bones of
some dinosaurs have large internal spaces. So do the bones of birds.
Because of these findings, some biologists believe that dinosaurs are
more closely related to birds than to reptiles.<br>
Taxonomy can be a useful tool for scientists who work in such areas
as agriculture, forestry, and medicine. Taxonomy can also help the
economy. For example, taxonomists can discover new sources of
lumber, foods, medicines, and energy. For example, a taxonomist
might know that a certain species of tree contains chemicals that
make good disinfectants (e.g., Shiferaw/Moringa). It is possible that a
closely related plant species could have the same useful substances. So
instead of having one source of chemicals, there may be two or more
sources.<br><br>
2.4. <u>Linnaean system of nomenclature</u><br><br>
<img src="iimagewow/img2.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
Linnaeus was a Swedish naturalist who initially graduated in medicine
but became interested in plants. He travelled in Scandinavia, England
and Eastern Europe, discovering and naming new plant species.
In 1735 he published his Systema Naturae, in which he accurately
described 7700 plant species and classified them. He further grouped
species into genera, genera into classes, and classes into orders. He
also classified over 4000 animals, but rather less successfully into
mammals, birds, insects and worms.<br>
Linnaeus refined and popularized the binomial system of naming
organisms, in which the first name represents the genus and the second
name the specific epithet. This system is still the official starting point
for naming or revising the names of organisms.<br>
Species must be named in such a way that the name is recognized all
over the world. For example, maize is named Bekkolo in Amharic,
Boqqollo in Afan Oromo and Baddelain Sidamu Affo and corn in
American English etc. If you are not aware of these names, it could
lead to confusion. If the botanical name, Zea mays, is used, however,
there is no chance of error. As you all might know our country is
endowed with cultural and linguistic diversities and each would have
different names for the same species. As a result, it would be difficult
for a person to know the names given by the 80 plus ethnolinguistic
groups in Ethiopia. Similarly, there are over thousands of languages in
the African continent and beyond.<br>
Therefore, the Latin form of the name allows it to be used in all over the
world irrespective of language barriers. The similarity in size, shape,
behavior and colormakes it difficult to differentiate one species from
the other. Again, the use of the scientific name avoids such confusion.
The binomial system of naming species (introduced by Linnaeus) is
an internationally agreed system in which the scientific name of an
organism is made up of two parts showing the genus and the species.
Binomial means �two names�; the first name gives the genus and the second gives the specific epithet. For example, Enset, false banana,
Ensete ventricosum and Banana, Musa acuminate, belong to the same
family (Musaceae).In writing a scientific name, the first letter of name
of the genus is a capitalized letter and the specific epithet always starts
with a small letter, for example, the scientific name of human beings is
Homo sapiens. The scientific names are underlined when handwritten
or italicized when printed.<br><br>
2.5 <u>Common Ethiopian animals and plants</u><br><br>
Ethiopia is endowed with high biological diversity (biodiversity)
due to its geographical location, topographical diversity and diverse
climatic features. The country is a hot spot for a diversity of wild plant
and animal species with a high degree of endemicity. Furthermore,
Ethiopia is a primary centre of diversity for field crops such as noug
(Guizotia abyssinica), tef (Eragrostis tef) and the Ethiopian mustard
(Brassica carinata). Besides, field crops such as barley, sorghum,
durum wheat, finger millet, faba bean, chickpea, lentil, and cowpea
have wide diversity in Ethiopia. Also Ethiopia has served as a gateway to
domestic animals from Asia to Africa and its diverse ecology favoured
diversification of these resources.<br>
Dichotomous keysare used to identify unfamiliar organisms. They
simplify the process of identification. Each key is made up of pairs of
contrasting features (dichotomous means two branches), starting with
quite general characteristics and progressing to more specific ones.
By following the key and making appropriate choices it is possible
to identify the organism correctly. Figure 2.3 shows an example of a
dichotomous key that could be used to place an unknown vertebrate
and unknown invertebrate in the correct class. Item 1 gives you a
choice between two alternatives. If the animal is poikilothermic
(cold-blooded), you move to item 2 and make a further choice. If it is
a homoiothermic (warm-blooded), you move to item 4 for your next
choice. The same technique may be used for assigning an organism to
its class, genus or species. However, the important features may not
always be easy to see and you have to make use of less fundamental
characteristics.<br><br>
2.6 <u>The five-kingdom system of classification</u><br><br>
Classification of organisms into plants and animals was easily done
and understood, but a large number of organisms did not fall into
either category. Hence the two kingdom classification used for a long
time was found inadequate. Besides, gross morphology a need was
also felt for including other characteristics like cell structure, nature
of cell wall, mode of nutrition, habitat, methods of reproduction,
evolutionary relationships, etc.
Whittaker (1969) proposed a five kingdom classification to solve
the pitfalls of the two kingdom system of classification. The main
criteria for classification used by him include cell structure, body
organization, mode of nutrition, reproduction and phylogenetic
relationships. Whittaker�s five-kingdom scheme consists of animals,
plants, fungi, monera and protists. It is still not easy to fit all organisms into the five-kingdom scheme. For example, many protista
with chlorophyll (the protophyta) show important resemblances to
some members of the algae, but the algae are classified into the plant
kingdom.<br>
Viruses are not included
in any kingdom � they are
not considered to be living
organisms because they
lack key characteristics
of living things. Viruses
are particles that are not
alive. They cause diseases
and infections. Viruses
are made up of nucleic
acids, either DNA or RNA,
surrounded by a protein
coat. They are smaller
than the tiniest bacterium.
Most biologists agree that
viruses are not alive because
they don�t grow, develop,
or carry out respiration.
All viruses replicate, or
make copies of themselves.
However, viruses need the
help of living cells to copy
themselves. In order to copy
itself, a virus must enter a
living cell. The cell in which
a virus replicates is called
the host cell.<br><br>
<u>Kingdom Monera</u><br>
Monera includes eubacteria and archaebacteria. Eubacteria (bacteria)
have strong cell walls. They exist in various shapes and forms. Some eubacteria are heterotrophs; otherscan make their
(autotrophs). Some autotrophic bacteria make their own food the way
plants do; they are photosynthetic. Others make energy by chemical
reactions; chemosynthetic. The eubacteria live in most habitats,
except the most extreme. Some eubacteria cause diseases, like strep
throat and pneumonia. Most eubacteria, however, are harmless and
helpful.<br>
<img src="iimagewow/img3.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
Archaebacteria (Archaea) have very different cell walls than
bacteria,ut like bacteria, archaebacteria make their own food. They are
chemosynthetic and photosynthetic. Archaebacteria live in extreme
environments. They live in such places as swamps, deep-ocean hotwater vents and seawater evaporating ponds. The environments in
which the archaebacteria live often have no oxygen.<br>
Most people tend to think of bacteria in terms of illness and disease.
However, there are actually only a few disease-causing bacteria
compared to the number of harmless and beneficial bacteria. In
fact, we could not survive without bacteria. Bacteria cause diseases
in plants, animals, and humans. Disease causing bacteria enter the
human body through openings such as the mouth. Bacteria are
carried in air, food, and water. Sometimes bacteria enter the body
through skin wounds. There are two ways bacterial diseases harm
people. First, the growth of bacteria can interfere with the normal
function of body tissues. Second, the bacteria can release a toxin that
directly attacks the host.<br><br>
<u>Kingdom Protista</u><br>
There is no such thing as a typical protist. Kingdom protista contains
the most diverse organisms of all the kingdoms.
There are single-celled (unicellular) protists as well as many-celled
(multicellular) protists. Some are microscopic, others are very large.
Some can make their own food, some cannot. Protists have only
one thing in common�they are all eukaryotes. That means most of
their metabolic processes (chemical reactions) take place inside their
membrane-bound organelles. Other than that, organisms classified
as protists are quite different from each other. Some protists, called
protozoans, seem to be like animals except that they only have one
cell. Others, called algae, seem to be like plants except they do not
have roots, stems, or leaves. Algae are photosynthetic and autotrophic.
Unicellular algae are the basis of aquatic food chains and produce
much of the oxygen in Earth�s atmosphere. Still, other protists seem to
be like fungi except that they do not have the same kind of cell walls
that fungi have.<br>
<img src="iimagewow/img4.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;">
<br><br>
<u>Kingdom Fungi</u><br>
Fungi are eukaryotic organisms that include microorganisms such as
yeasts, moulds and mushrooms.
Except for unicellular yeasts, fungi are filamentous multicellular
organisms.
Their bodies consist of long, slender thread-like structures called
hyphae. Hyphae play an important role in how they obtain food.
Fungi possess a cell wall that is made up of chitin and polysaccharides.
Like animals, fungi are heterotrophic in nutrition. But unlike animals,
fungi do not ingest (eat) their food. Instead, a fungus absorbs nutrients
from the environment outside of its body. Many fungi accomplish
this task by secreting powerful enzymes into their surroundings,
digest compounds from a wide range of sources, living or dead.
These enzymes break down complex molecules into smaller organic
compounds that the fungi can absorb into their bodies and use.<br>
<img src="iimagewow/img5.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
Most fungi absorb soluble organic matter from dead substrates and
hence are called saprophytes (decomposers). Decomposer fungi
break down and absorb nutrients from nonliving organic material,
such as fallen logs, animal corpses, and the wastes of living organisms.
Fungi cannot make their own food. They are heterotrophs. Fungi use
a process called extracellular digestion to obtain nutrients. This means
food is digested outside a fungus�s cells and then the digested food
is absorbed. For example, some hyphae of a fungus will grow into
an orange. They release digestive enzymes into the orange that break
down the large organic molecules into smaller molecules. These small
molecules are absorbed into the hyphae and move into the flowing
cytoplasm.
Fungi can also live with different living as parasites or mutualists.
Parasitic fungi absorb nutrients from the cells of living hosts. Some
parasitic fungi are pathogenic, causing diseases in humans (Example:
Candida albicans cause rush and Tinea pedis cause athlete�s foot),
animals and plants. Mutualistic fungi also absorb nutrients from a
host organism, but they reciprocate with actions that benefit the host.
For example, mutualistic fungi that live inside certain termite species
use their enzymes to break down wood, making food available for
termites. Fungi can also live as symbionts in association with algae as
lichens and with roots of higher plants as mycorrhiza.
Fungi can reproduce either by vegetative means (fragmentation,
fission and budding), asexual reproduction through spores formation
and sexually. The various spores are produced in distinct structures
called fruiting bodies
Yeast (saccharomyces service) is a very important fungus used for
making injera rise and allows us to make alcohol (Tej, Tella, Beer etc).<br><br>
<u>Key Terms</u><br>
Mutualism: symbiotic
relationship in which
both species benefit.<br>
Parasitism: symbiotic
relationship in which
one organism benefits at
the expense of another.<br>
Symbiosis: permanent,
close association between
two or more organisms
of different species.<br>
Some fungi cause food
to spoil, others cause
diseases, and some are
even poisonous. However,
fungi are important and
beneficial. Without fungi,
the world would be overrun
with huge amounts of waste,
dead organisms, and dead
plants. Thanks to many
fungi, some bacteria, and
protists, the organic material
is broken down and recycled
into the raw materials that
other living organisms need.<br>
<u>Kingdom Plantae</u><br>
Kingdom Plantae includes all eukaryotic, and multicellular
autotrophic organisms.
Plants make their own food through the process of photosynthesis.
Plants have chloroplast and chlorophyll pigment, which is required
for photosynthesis. Photosynthesis also provides oxygen in the
atmosphere.
They do not move from place to place; they are stationary.
Their cells contain a rigid cell wall made up of cellulose.
They reproduce asexually by vegetative propagation or sexually.
There are over 250,000 species of plants. These include flowering
plants, mosses, ferns, and coniferous plants.<br>
<img src="iimagewow/img6.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
<u>Key Terms</u><br>
Angiosperms: Most diverse seed plant group. Only group that
makes flowers and fruits.<br>
Bryophyte: is the common name for three lineages of plants:
mosses, liverworts, and hornworts.<br>
Dicots: Most diverse groups of angiosperms; members have two
seed leaves, branching leaf veins.<br>
Embryophyta: land plants; photosynthetic species that protect and
nourish the embryo on the parental body<br>
Gymnosperm: Seed plant that does not make flowers or fruits; for
example, a conifer.<br>
Monocots: Highly diverse angiosperm group; includes plants such
as grasses that have one seed leaf and parallel veins.<br>
Seed plant (spermatophyte): Plant that produces seeds and pollen;
an angiosperm or gymnosperm.<br>
Vascular plant: Plant having specialized tissues (xylem and phloem)
that transport water and sugar within the plant body.<br><br>
<u>Kingdom Animalia</u><br>
Kingdom Animalia includes all multicellular, heterotrophic,
eukaryotic animals. Constructing a good definition of an animal is not straightforward, as there are exceptions to nearly every criterion
for distinguishing animals from other life forms. However, several
characteristics of animals, when taken together, sufficiently define
them.
Animals differ from both plants and fungi in their mode of nutrition.
Unlike plants, animals are not photosynthetic. Animals consume food
obtained from other organisms (i.e. they are heterotrophs). But unlike
fungi, most animals do not feed by absorption; instead, animals ingest
their food and then use enzymes to digest it within their bodies.
In contrast to plants and fungi, however, animals lack the structural
support of cell walls. Instead, animal cells are held together by structural
proteins, the most abundant being collagen, which is found only in
animals.
Many animals have two types of specialized cells not seen in other
multicellular organisms: muscle cells and nerve cells. In most animals,
these cells are organized into muscle tissue and nervous tissue,
respectively, and are responsible for moving the body and conducting
nerve impulses.
The ability to move and conduct nerve impulses underlies many of the
adaptations that differentiate animals from plants and fungi, making
muscle and nerve cells central to what it means to be an animal.
Most animals reproduce sexually.
Animals are very diverse. They are generally classified into two groups
based on the presence or absence of backbone as invertebrates (animals
with no backbone) and vertebrates (animals with a backbone)<br>
<u>Key Terms</u><br>
Anatomy: the study of internal structure, as revealed by dissection.<br>
Invertebrates: are animals without a backbone.<br>
Morphology: is the study of the form or outward appearance of
organisms.<br>
Vertebrates: are animals with a backbone.<br>
2.7 <u>Renowned Taxonomists in Ethiopia</u><br>
As stated in section 2.5, Ethiopia is known for high
degree speciesdiversity and endemcity. However, only few studies
have been done to identify, name and classify the biodiversity at
different levels (e.g., gene, species, and ecosystem).. Among the factors
that led to inadequate level of studies done in Ethiopia in the field of
biodiversity could be due to the few number of scientists educated
and trained in taxonomy despite the country�s rich biodiversity.<br>
Yet, as the result of efforts made over the past six decades, our country
has trained and educated a couple of renowned taxonomists that
contributed the publication of volumes of books on the Flora of
Ethiopia, for example. Among these scientists are Dr. Mesfin Taddese,
Professor Sebsebe Demissew, Professor Ensermu Kelbessa and
Professor Silesh Nemomissa to mention a few of them. In addition,
there are few other zoologists like Professor Abebe Getahun; who
contributed to the field of animal taxonomy. Below, we will discuss
briefly the contributions made by some distinguished Ethiopian
taxonomists to the scientific community in general and Ethiopian
society in particular.<br>
Professor Sebsebe Demissew has participated in several successful
research projects universities in Europe and Africa. He has published
books and articles on the vegetation and plants of Ethiopia and
Africa. He is a member of national and international professional
organizations and has served as Chair of the Biological Society of
Ethiopia, Secretary-General of the Association for theTaxonomicStudy
of the Flora Tropical Africa (AETFAT) in addition to being a Council
member of the International Association for Plant Taxonomy. He has
also served as a director of Flora of Ethiopia and Gulelle botanical
Garden.<br>

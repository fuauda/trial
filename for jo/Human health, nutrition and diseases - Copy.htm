5.1 <u>What is food?</u><br><br>
Food is any beneficial substance that is eaten, drunk, or otherwise
taken into the body to sustain life, provide energy, promote growth,
etc. It is consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism.
Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin, and contains
essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or
minerals<br>

The importance of food in living things:<br>
Growth: Food is the source substances necessary for making new
cells, tissues and organs.<br>
Energy: living things undergo different biological and chemical
reaction in their bodies. These reactions in living things produce at
the same time require energy. Food is the sources of energy that fuel all the biological activities.
Running, jumping, moving, growing, reproducing, and all other
activities require energy.<br>

Replacement of damaged tissues: Food is required for making new
cell and used to replace damaged cells of the body.
Protect from diseases: There are different types of diseases caused by
the shortage of specific groups of foods. Our body requires these food
groups to protect our body from deficiency diseases and to become
healthy.<br><br>

5.2 <u>Nutrition</u><br><br>


Nutrition is the process of taking in food and converting it into energy
and other vital nutrients required for life. Energy obtained from food
is important for different activities of the body. The food we eat keeps
us alive and provides the nourishment for growth, repairs of our body
cells and maintain good health.<br><br>


5.3. <u>Nutrients</u><br><br>

Nutrients: are important chemical substances that are found in foods.
In human body, we need nutrients for growth, source of energy and
stay healthy. We obtain these nutrients from the foods we eat. The
five important classes of nutrients are: carbohydrates, proteins, lipids
(Fats and oil),vitamins, minerals and water.<br>
Macronutrients and Micronutrients<br>
The three nutrients, carbohydrate, protein and fats are required in
large quantities. Such nutrients are called macronutrients. In contrast,
minerals and vitamins are needed in very small quantities and are
called micronutrients.<br>
Vitamins are organic compounds, whereas minerals are inorganic
compounds. Vitamins and minerals do not supply energy but they
play an important role in the regulation of the metabolic activity in the
body and help in the utilization of proteins, fats and carbohydrates<br>

Minerals are also used for the formation of body structure and
skeleton.<br><br>

Carbohydrates<br>
Carbohydrates are types of nutrients that provide energy for the
human body. They are composed of three elements, carbon, oxygen
and hydrogen. The human body gets carbohydrate from green plants.
These green plants prepare carbohydrate in the form of starch by the
process of Photosynthesis. They combine carbon dioxide and water
using energy from the sun in order to produce carbohydrate. Such
carbohydrates are the major sources of energy in our diet. Starch is
abundant in potatoes, bread, maize, rice and other cereals. Sugar
appears in our diet mainly as sucrose (table sugar) and is added to
drinks and many prepared foods such as biscuits and cakes. Sugars
also occur naturally in many fruits and some vegetables. One gram
of carbohydrate can provide, on average, 16 kilojoules (kJ) of energy.
An unavailable or indigestible carbohydrate provides dietary fiber
that does not serve as a source of energy. This indigestible part is a
product of plant’s cell walls that consists mainly of cellulose. Human
body does not have any enzymes for the digestion of this cellulose.
Therefore, the plant cell walls reach the large intestine (colon)
without being digested. This undigested part of the diet is called fiber
or roughage. The colon contains many bacteria that can digest some
of the substances in the plant cell walls to form fatty acids.
The fibre and the bacteria, which multiply from feeding on it, add bulk
to the contents of the colon and help it to recollect water. This softens
the feces and reduces the time needed for the undigested residues to
pass out of the body. Both effects help to prevent constipation and
keep the colon healthy and increase bowel movement. It is found in
vegetables, fruits, and grains.<br><br>

There are three types of carbohydrates<br><br>
• Monosaccharide The simplest carbohydrate is simple sugar or
monosaccharide which include glucose, fructose and galactose.
These three monosaccharide each have six carbon atoms, so
they are also known as hexose sugars. Their molecular formula is
C6H12O6.<br>
• Disaccharide: Similar to other carbohydrates, disaccharides are
comprised of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen, and the ratio of
hydrogen atoms to oxygen atoms is often 2:1. it is the combination
of two simple sugars to form a complex sugar called disaccharide.
These are maltose( Glucose+ Glucose), sucrose (Glucose+
Fructose and lactose (Glucose+ Galactose). The general chemical
formula of disaccharides is C12H22O11<br>

• Polysaccharide, which is formed when many simple sugar join
together. They are substances whose molecules contain hundreds
or thousands of monosaccharaides linked together into long
chains. polysaccharides are found in plant cell as cellulose and
starch. In addition it stored in animals as glycogen. Polysaccharide
are not soluble in water. The general formula of (C6H10O5)n.<br><br>

Fats and Oils<br>
Fats and oils are high-energy nutrients that provide 35 to 45% of caloric
intake. One gram of lipid gives 37 kJ of energy. Like carbohydrates,
fats and oils are composed of three elements, carbon, oxygen and
hydrogen. Fats are obtained from animal source and are solid at
room temperature while oils are from plant source and liquid at room
temperature. The major sources of fat are meat, milk, cheese, butter
and egg-yolk. We obtain oils from fruits, seeds(e.g. sunflower seed).
In human body, lipid is used to make fatty tissue, adipose tissue,
under the skin forms a layer that can reduce heat losses from the body.
Besides satisfying metabolic energy needs, dietary fat, also serve as a
vehicle for the absorption of the fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K).<br><br>

Proteins<br>
Proteins are nutrients, which provide growth of the body and build a
new cell. It is made up of amino acid composed of carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen and nitrogen. In all living things, the structural part of the cell
is composed of protein.
The major sources of dietary proteins from animals are meat, fish,
eggs, milk and cheese. Plants such as beans, chickpea, soy beans and
nuts are also important protein sources<br><br>


Vitamins (Types)<br>
Vitamins are nutrients, which are essential in small quantities for
human body. They are organic substances needed for chemical
reactions of human cells. Plants can make these vitamins in their
leaves, but animals as well as human have to obtain many of them
ready-made either from plants or from other animals. If any one of
the vitamins is missing or deficient in the diet, the vitamin- deficiency
disease may develop. Examples of vitamins: are vitamin A, vitamin E,
thiamine (vitamin B1) and riboflavin (vitamin B2), and vitamin C.<br><br>

Minerals<br>
Minerals are inorganic substances, which are essential in small
quantities for human body. The major minerals, which are necessary
for human body, are Calcium, Iron, phosphorous and Iron.
Calcium is used to build teeth and bones, it make muscles to contract
and help for the transmission of nerve impulses. The important
sources of calcium are milk, cheese etc.
Iron is a mineral which synthesizes the hemoglobin of red
blood cells. Hemoglobin is a molecule, which carries oxygen in
blood. The sources of iron in the diet are red meat, liver, kidney, eggs,
groundnuts, Tikur teff etc.
Iodine is a mineral, which makes thyroid gland to work properly.
The source iodine is iodized salt and seafood.
Phosphorus is a mineral required to build bones in animal as well as
humans body.<br><br>

Water<br>
Body fluids such as blood, lymph and tissue fluid are mainly composed
of water. The transportation of digested food into the body cell and
excretion of excess salt and urea out of the body is possible because
of water. Thus, water acts as a solvent and as a transport medium for
substances throughout the body.<br><br>


5.4. <u>Balanced diets</u><br><br>

Ethiopia has multicultural societies. These diverse societies have
different types of cultural foods. All these foods are different in their
preparation, flavor and ingredients. In addition, different people prefer
different food types. Some may prefer to feed on vegetables; others
may carbohydrate, animal protein etc. Different food or diet may
contain important composition of the above important nutrients.
In contrast, some diet may result in health problem because it may
contain high amount of fat or high amount of animal protein, etc.<br>

The diet that contains all of the nutrients in the correct amount and
proportion is termed as a balanced diet. A balanced diet must contain
enough proportion of carbohydrates and fats to meet our energy
requirement. It should also contain enough protein of the right kind
to provide the amino acids to make new cells and produce tissues
growth. The diet must also contain vitamins and mineral salts, plant
fiber and water for normal functioning of the body. Therefore, a
balanced diet gives us all the essential substances that we need in the
right quantities.<br>

The feeding habit of people depends on where they live, their social
issues, their age, their sex their personal activity and physiological
conditions etc. For example, a pregnant woman should eat more food
for the development and growth of her baby. She should get more
minerals like calcium for the development of bone and teeth of her
baby. Children have a greater energy requirement than adults because
they are still in the process of growth. Young children also need more
protein than adult does because they are constantly developing and
making new cells. Elderly people generally have lower energy and
protein needs. However, they need to eat a balanced diet in order to
stay healthy.<br>



Naturally, female have a relatively higher fat content in their bodies
than male. Fat in female body is stored in fat tissue, such as under the
skin. These fatty tissues have a lower metabolic rate than muscular
tissue, so women generally have a lower energy requirement than men.
Therefore, men should eat relatively more energy food than women
should. Some jobs that involve physical activity require more energy
than less active jobs. People who are usually work physical exercise
such as athletes also require high energy and high protein diets. The
extra protein is required for muscle development.<br><br>

5.5 <u>Deficiency diseases</u><br><br>


Human body requires a balanced diet for normal functioning of the
body. If food intake in human body is inadequate in carbohydrate,
proteins, minerals or vitamins, it causes deficiency diseases. A
deficiency disease occurs when a person does not have enough
amount of one particular nutrient and suffers health problems as a
result. Examples of deficiency diseases are Kwashiorkor, Marasmus,
Anemia, Rickets and Scurvy etc.<br><br>

Kwashiorkor<br>
Kwashiorkor is a deficiency disease caused by inadequate protein
content in human body especially in children. Some symptoms of
kwashiorkor are dry or flaky skin, swelling of leg and abdomen, and
changes of the hair color, weakness and irritability. Protein deficiency
can often be cured or prevented by an intake of protein.<br><br>


Marasmus<br>
Marasmus is a deficiency disease caused by inadequate carbohydrate
content in the human body. Like kwashiorkor, the incidence of ma
rasmus increases in children. The symptoms of marasmus are thin
arm and leg, little muscle, old-looking face. Peoples with this disease
are extremely thin with reduced fat and muscle tissue. Their skin is
thin and hangs in folds. Treatment involves delivery of an energy rich,
balanced diet.<br><br>

Anemia<br>
Anemia is a deficiency disease caused by the lack of iron. A human
adult should take enough amount of iron, which is important for the
normal functioning of the body. A human body could not produce
enough hemoglobin if the amount of iron in the blood is insufficient.
Less hemoglobin in the body results in less oxygen transportation.
If the oxygen level of blood became less, it results in less respiration
producing less energy. The symptom of anemia includes feeling weak,
tired and irritable. It can treat or protect by using iron capsules and by
consuming iron rich food.<br><br>

Rickets<br>
Deficiency disease caused by the shortage of vitamin D is called
Rickets. It results in deformed bones in the legs of children. Vitamin
D is the only vitamin that the human body can make upon exposure
of the skin to sunlight. In addition, oily fish, butter, milk, cheese and egg-yolk are some foods that provide vitamin D. Vitamin D help in the
absorption of calcium and phosphorus through the gut wall, which is
important to build bone and teeth.<br><br>

Scurvy<br>
Scurvy is a deficiency disease caused by a lack of vitamin C (ascorbic
acid). This deficiency disease occurs when fibres in the connective
tissue of skin and blood vessels do not form properly. This disease
causes bleeding under the skin, particularly at the joints, bleeding gums
and poor healing of wounds. Vitamin C can’t be stored in the body
therefore, it is important to take it daily. The good sources of vitamin
C are oranges, lemons, grapefruit, tomatoes, fresh green vegetables.<br><br>

5.6 <u>Malnutrition</u><br><br>

Malnutrition is defined as the insufficient, excessive or imbalanced
consumption of nutrients, which leads to health problems. The causes
of malnutrition can be poverty, famine due to drought or flood, soil
erosion, wars, too little land for too many people, ignorance of proper
nutritional requirements.<br>

The dual burden of malnutrition consists of both under nutrition and
overweight and obesity, as well as diet-related non communicable
diseases.<br>

Under nutrition the most common form of malnutrition is caused by
under nutrition of protein and dietary energy (Carbohydrate, lipids).
If the total intake of food is not sufficient to meet the body’s need
for energy, it leads to loss of weight, muscle wastage, weakness and
ultimately starvation. Extreme reduction of diets, such as carbohydrate
foods can result in the deficiency disease like marasmus. The victims
of malnutrition due to food deficiencies have reduced resistance to
different types of diseases. Under nutrition addresses the following
four broad groups of conditions:<br>

Wasting (low weight-for-height) is defined as low weight-for-height.
It often indicates recent and severe weight loss, although it can also
persist for a long time. It usually occurs when a person has not had
food of adequate quality and quantity and/or they have had frequent
or prolonged illnesses. Wasting in children is associated with a higher
risk of death if not treated properly.<br>

Stunting (low height-for-age), is defined as low height for age. It is the
result of chronic or recurrent under nutrition, usually associated with
poverty, poor maternal health and nutrition, frequent illness and/or
inappropriate feeding and care in early life. Stunting prevents children
from reaching their physical and cognitive potential.<br>
Underweight (low weight-for-age) is defined as low weight-for-age.
Micronutrient deficiencies are a lack of vitamins and minerals that
are essential for body functions such as producing enzymes, hormones
and other substances needed for growth and development.
In contrast, when the diet contains too much fat it causes diseases like
coronary heart disease. If fatty substance builds up in the arteries,
it reduces the diameter of these blood vessels which results in blood
clots and leads to heart attack.<br>

Obesity: If you eat more food than you want, your body stores the
extra food as fat. Then the stored fat results in obesity (overweight).
People with overweight may use diet contains fattening foods, such as
high fat foods and foods with a lot of sugar.<br>

Obesity is caused because of an imbalance between the energy store
in human body and the energy released. An increase in consumption
of high-energy foods, without an equal increase in physical activity
leads to an unhealthy increase in weight. In other way, decreased levels
of physical activity can also result in an energy imbalance and lead to
weight gain.<br>

People who are overweight and obese are at high risk to have health
problems such as, heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and
arthritis (worn joints).<br><br>


Obesity can be controlled by<br>
• Eating less high energy foods (lower energy intake)<br>
• Taking more exercise (increase energy output).<br>
• Eating a balanced diet with a lower intake of energy<br>

5.7. <u>Substance abuse</u><br><br>


Drugs<br>
A drug is any substance taken into the body that change and affects
chemical reactions in the body. It can be taken legally to reduce a
symptom such as a headache or to treat a different types of infection,
this is called medicinal drugs. There are also other drugs which could
also be one taken illegally in order to provide stimulation or induce
sleep or create hallucinations (recreational drugs).<br><br>

Can drugs be found in our food?<br>
Drugs are present in many food products such as: tea, coffee, energy
drinks and alcoholic drinks. Though they have many useful medicinal
properties their stimulant properties can produce caffeinism, a nasty
condition that can readily addict.<br><br>

What is substance abuse?<br>
Substance abuse is using legal or illegal drugs (substances) in the
wrong way or in the excess amount. Some of the drugs are medical
drugs taken legally to reduce a symptom and pain of diseases. These
drugs designed to suppress pain, treat and cure diseases. In addition
to medical substances, other legal substances are present in many
products such as:<br>

• tea, coffee and ‘energy drinks’ (caffeine)<br>
• tobacco(nicotine)<br>
• alcoholic drinks (alcohol)<br><br>

Although these substances are legal, they can cause serious effects
when taken excessively or over long periods of time.
Peoples are using drugs illegally to provide stimulation, induce sleep,
or create hallucinations (recreational drugs) example of such drugs
are: alcohol, tobacco, Khat, heroin etc. Peoples are also using alcohol,
nicotine and caffeine for their pleasurable effects, to help them relax
or concentrate. Some of the commonly practiced drugs in our country
include:<br><br>

1. Cigarettes smoking<br>
Cigarette is made up of a plant called tobacco (Nicotiana tobacum)
which originally cultivated and used in Central America. People use
cigarette in order to stimulate their body or because they are addicted
to it.
The chemical composition of cigarette leads to addiction and problem
in human health. The main components of cigarette or tobacco are
tar, carbon monoxide and Nicotine.<br><br>

i. Tar <br>

Tar is the black sticky substance found in cigarette that collects in the
lungs when the smoke cools. The health effect of tar can be chronic
bronchitis, lung cancer etc.<br><br>
Chronic bronchitis<br>
When people smoke cigarette, the chemical substance called tar
accumulates in the bronchioles. Tar irritates the lining of the
bronchioles and stimulates the production of excess mucus. The
function of cilia in our lung is to remove dust, dirty and excess mucus
from the lining of lungs. However, when cilia damaged by smoking,
it will be difficult for cilia to remove the excess mucus and dirt. This
leads to the collection of dirt, bacteria and viruses that block the
bronchioles. This stimulates smoker’s to cough which is an effort to
move the mucus, the bronchioles and bronchi becomes thicker. This
thickening of the bronchioles causes them to narrow and makes it
difficult to breathe, this leads to infections such as pneumonia. This
damage and obstruction of the airways is chronic bronchitis
In addition, there are different chemical compounds in tar such as
carcinogen (produce cancer) compounds. Cancer starts because of the
changes in the epithelial cells of the lungs that lead to the development
of a mass of cells, known as a tumor. It is this tumor which results in
cancer.<br><br>

Emphysema<br>
Smokers usually have weakened alveoli wall because of the above
action of tar that result in coughing. During coughing, some of the
weakened alveoli burst. Then the amount of alveoli decrease as well
as absorbing surface of the lungs is greatly reduced. Then the smoker
cannot oxygenate his or her blood properly and the least exertion
makes the person breathless and exhausted. Bronchioles collapse
during expiration, trapping air in the alveoli, which often burst. This
condition is called emphysema.<br><br>

ii. Carbon monoxide<br>
Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas found in cigarette. During
cigarette smoking, the carbon monoxide enters to lung. This carbon
monoxide diffuses across the walls of the alveoli and diffuses into red
blood cells where it combines with hemoglobin to form the compound
carboxy-hemoglobin.<br>
The carbon monoxide combines permanently with hemoglobin. Then
no more oxygen is carried by hemoglobin that results in the reduction
of the volume of oxygen in blood. Therefore, less oxygen is supplied
to the heart. In this case, the heart beat increases to get more oxygen.
Carbon monoxide may also damage the lining of the blood vessels.
In this case, smokers put the health of their cardiovascular system at
risk. The damaging of the walls of arteries may lead to the build-up of
fatty tissue and the reduction of blood flow. This may result coronary
heart disease (CHD) and stroke. These diseases are a major cause of
death and disability in the world.<br><br>

iii. Nicotine<br>
Nicotine is a compound found in cigarette. It is a stimulating and
relaxing compound which has a molecular structure that allows it to
interact with our nervous system. In addition to its stimulating effect,
nicotine is a compound which produce addiction.
When people smoke cigarettes, nicotine from cigarette is absorbed
through the alveoli to enter the Blood stream. Then it is able to go to
the brain through blood circulation.
In the brain, nicotine activates the release of dopamine, the natural
neurotransmitter substance associated with our experience of pleasure.
Long-term exposure to nicotine eventually comes to have the reverse effect, actually depressing the ability to experience pleasure. So
more nicotine is needed to ‘satisfy’, and cigarettes become addictive.
Smokers find it increasingly hard to quit the habit.
Nicotine also increases the heart rate and blood pressure. It narrows
the arterioles, which increases blood pressure. It decreases the blood
flow, particularly in the hands and feet, and it makes blood clotting
more likely. It also increases the stickiness of blood platelets that
promote blood clotting.<br>

2. Drinking Alcohol<br>
Alcohol is a socially acceptable drug in many countries including
Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, there are different types of alcohol drinks such
as Tella, Arekie (Katicala), Beer, Wine. When human body consumes
alcohol, it is absorbed through the wall of the stomach and small
intestine and it is absorbed into the blood. Alcohol gets distributed
through- out the body by the help of blood circulation. It is absorbed
by liver cells and broken down by liver enzymes, There- fore its
concentration in the blood decreases gradually.
Alcohol is a depressant. It affects the brain by slowing down the
transmission of nerve impulses. Consuming larger quantities of
alcohol leads to:<br>
i. Loss of coordination,<br>
ii. Loss of self-control.<br>
iii. Loss of judgment and control of movements<br>
iv. Slower reaction times(the interval between receiving a stimulus
and making a response) loss of judgment and slower reaction times<br><br>

Alcohol drink and addiction<br>
Some people become dependent upon alcohol and they are referred
to as alcoholics. They feel tense and irritable. It is hard to cope with everyday problems without drinking they develop a tolerance as more
enzymes that metabolize alcohol are made in the liver. They therefore
need to take greater quantities of alcohol to get the same effect.
Alcoholics can cause their families pain and unhappiness. They can
become aggressive after drinking and spend a lot of money on drink.
There are also other social problems such as crime, family disputes,
marital breakdown, child neglect and abuse, absenteeism from work,
vandalism, assault and violent crime including murder.<br><br>

Long-term effects of alcohol<br>
Drinking large quantities of alcohol over a number of years can lead
to stomach ulcers, heart disease and brain dam- age. In addition, large
amount of alcohol damage the liver tissue and replaced by scar tissue
known as cirrhosis. This condition may leads to death unless the
person stops drinking.<br><br>

3. Heroin<br>
Heroin is a powerful depressant that slows down the nervous system.
It has a chemical structure that is similar to endorphins, a group of
chemicals that are found in the brain. Endorphins are made naturally
in the brain and pro- vide relief when the body experiences pain or
stress.
Endorphins work on the synapses in the brain and preventing neurons
from transmitting impulses from pain receptors, so they producing
pain relief. When a person takes heroin, the heroin molecules bind
to the endorphin receptor sites, blocking nerve transmission. This
mimics the function of natural endorphins. Therefore, by using
heroin, the feeling of pain disappears and addiction produced. People
practice to take heroin to reduce the pain. This is how the body
develops a tolerance to the drug, and it has to be taken in ever-greater
quantities in order to feel euphoria or just to reduce the pain.<br><br>

4. Cannabis<br>
Cannabis is the most commonly used illegal drug in the world. It is
drug from Cannabis plant. Mostly it is the flower of cannabis plant,
harvested, dried, and used as drug. Some people named this drug
as weed, some call it pot, and others call it marijuana. This cannabis
plant has been used as a drug for both recreational and traditional
medicines for a long period. This drug contains a stimulant or
psychoactive component called Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).
Peoples used this cannabis by smoking, vaporizing, together to food
and as extract.<br>
<img src="img59.png" height="200" width="300" style="border-radius: 30px; margin: 20px;"><br>
Cannabis causes: enjoyment, different states of mind and sense of
time, difficulty concentrating, reduced short-term memory and body
action relaxation and it results in an increase in appetite. The effect of cannabis in human body last for two to six hours, based on the quantity
of the drug used. When cannabis is taken at high amount, it causes
mental effects like: nervousness, panic, false beliefs, hallucinations,
suspicion, and psychosis.<br><br>

5. Chewing khat<br>
Khat (Catha edulis) is bushy plant whose leaves are chewed for its
stimulant effect. This plant is grown in southern Arabia and Eastern
Africa including Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya. Khat is usually
supplied as a bundle of leaves and fresh shoots wrapped in false
banana leaves.
Khat contains a chemical compound known as cathinone, which
affects central nervous system (CNS). This cathinone can be found
only in fresh Khat leaves. Chewing khat releases Cathinone into
the saliva that can be absorbed to the body easily. Only fresh leaves
are chewed, because cathinone soon degrades into old in dry plant
material.
Although khat can be ingested as an infusion or smoked, the most
common route of administration is to chew the fresh plant. The juice
of the masticated material is swallowed, while the residues are spat
out. In some places, teas from dried leaves are also consumed.
Ethiopia is one of the country where large number of people with the
habit of chewing chat. In the previous years, it was mainly cultivated
in eastern part of the country. However, currently, it is grown and
consumed in all parts of the country.
This current increment in khat consumption brings socio-economic,
psychological and physical health consequence on the individuals
involved. Chewing khat induce a state of joy and feelings of increased
alertness and stimulation. At the end its consequence results in a
depressed mood, irritability, loss of appetite, gastritis and peptic ulcer,
disease and difficulty sleeping. In addition, the habit of chewing khat
leads to some social problems like family fragment, multiple sexual
practices and the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) due
to unprotected sex. Early initiation of sexual activity was also reported
among Khat chewers.<br><br>

6. Doping<br>
The term “doping” refers to the use of prohibited medications, drugs,
or treatments in competitive sports . It is practiced in athletes with
the intention of improving athletic performance. Performance
enhancing drugs (PEDs) is another term used to for drugs used by
athletes to improve their athletic performance.
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) uses a battery of blood and urine tests to determine if athletes are cheating. A key tool is the
biological passport program, which tests all athletes for doping and
performance enhancing drugs.<br><br>

Why is doping such a big deal?<br>
The most important reason doping is a big deal is the fact that many
of these substances can have harmful and long-lasting side effects
which may include:<br>
Cardiovascular: irregular heart rhythm, elevated blood pressure,
heart attack, sudden death.<br>
Central Nervous System: insomnia, anxiousness, depression,
aggressive behavior, suicide, headache, addiction with withdrawal,
psychosis, tremor, dizziness, stroke<br>
Respiratory: nose bleeds, sinusitis<br>
Hormonal: infertility, gynecomastia (enlarged breasts), decreased
testicular size, low sex drive, acromegaly (coarse bones in face, hands,
and feet), cancer<br><br>

The second issue is more of a moral dilemma. These banned substances
are used to gain an unfair advantage which significantly diminishes
the spirit of competition.<br>
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), has a program which has
a purpose, to protect the athletes’ fundamental right to participate in
doping-free sport and thus promote health, fairness and equality for
athletes worldwide.<br><br>

What substances are banned from use?<br>
Some drugs are banned both in and out of competition due to their
performance enhancing properties, while others are only banned
during competition. Another reason for banning a drug is due to their
ability to mask the presence of a different banned drug during testing.
In general, the following classes of drugs are banned: Street drugs,
stimulants, anabolic steroids, peptide hormones (i.e. human growth
hormone [hGH]), alcohol and beta blockers (for archery and rifle
shooting only), diuretics, beta-2 agonists, anti-estrogens, blood
doping, and gene manipulation.<br>

Prohibited list: some drugs are listed on Prohibited list which
is thedocument identifying the substances and methods that are
prohibited in competition, out of competition, and in particular
sports.<br>
The criteria for adding a substance to the prohibited list are:- Must
meet any 2 of the following 3 criteria:<br>
• It has the potential to enhance or enhances sport performance;<br>
• It represents an actual or potential health risk to the athlete;<br>
• It violates the Spirit of Sport.<br><br>

Substances & methods prohibited at all times: all prohibited
substances in this class are non-specified substances anabolic agents
are prohibited, ptide hormones, growth factors, related substances,
and mimetics, growth factors and growth factor modulators, beta-2
agonists, hormone and metabolic modulators, diuretics And gene
doping, masking agents, blood doping, Substances & methods
prohibited in competition: Stimulants, narcotics, cannabinoids,
glucocorticoids<br><br>

Prohibited in particular sports:- Beta-blockers<br>
For athletes who need a banned drug for legitimate medical reasons,
the anti-doping programs offer a way to request a therapeutic use of
exemption (TUE) so the athlete can use the drug. The athlete must
have a physician complete a TUE form that states the athlete needs
the drug to treat their medical condition and that an alternative nonbanned drug is not available or insufficiently treats their condition.
The TUE is reviewed by a medical committee, which either allows the
athlete to take the drug or denies the athlete’s request<br><br>

Doping Consequences<br>
1. Physical and Mental Health: - Physical health: depending on
the substance, the dosage, and the consumption frequency, doping
products may have particularly negative side effects on health. Some
damages to the body are irreversible and may lead the athlete’s life
to be in great danger. The following section will outline the possible
health consequences and sports benefits to using certain groups of
doping substances.<br>
Steroids: General side effects:<br>
• Increased risk of liver disease<br>
• Increased risk of cardiovascular disease<br>
• High blood pressure<br>
• Acne<br>
• Baldness<br><br>

In Males: Shrinking testicles, sexual side effects (reduced sperm
production, impotence, libido disorders) Breast growth<br>
In Females: Deepening of voice Excessive hair growth on face &
body abnormal menstrual cycles<br>
Enlarged clitoris<br>
Erythropoietin (EPO)<br>
Increased blood viscosity (thickness/stickiness)<br>
• Pulmonary embolism<br>
• Increased risk of heart attack and stroke<br>
• General weakness<br>
• High blood pressure<br>
Human Growth Hormone<br>
• Severe headaches<br>
• Loss of vision<br>
• High blood pressure and heart failure<br>
• Diabetes and tumors<br>
• Crippling arthritis<br>
• Irreversible acromegaly<br>
• Enlargement of the hands & feet<br>
• Protruding forehead, brow, skull & jaw<br>
• Heart enlargement<br>
• Water retention<br>
• Liver and thyroid damage<br><br>
2. Psychological health- Some doping substances may not be
detrimental to the body but exercise an impact on mental health. It
has been scientifically evidenced that anxiety, obsessive disorders, or
psychosis are direct consequences of doping.<br>
• Psychological dependence<br>
• Increased aggression<br>
• Mood swings<br><br>
3. Social consequences- The existence of an athlete who was held
guilty of doping may be completely disrupted. Indeed, doping may
represent a danger to health, but it may also be prejudicial to fame,
respect, and creditworthiness. Even in the future negative findings are
regularly questioned by the media and the entourage. The poor image
will remain in the collective unconscious and the athlete could remain
isolated.<br><br>
4. Financial consequences:- As regards high-performance sports, an
infringement of anti-doping rules often leads to a loss of income, the
reimbursement of prize money, and of sponsorship money. An athlete suspended for several years, or even life-banned, cannot earn his/her
living as usual and can be forced countries loss foreign treasures from
athletes even banned countries from any sport competition in the
world.<br><br>
5. Sporting consequences:- A doping violation may mean loss of
results, rankings, medals, and qualification places at events. It could
also have an impact on members of a team causing medals to be lost
a day-to-day basis.<br><br>
6. Legal consequences:- Doping may have major legal consequences.
A doped athlete may be suspended, i.e., he/she may not take part in a
sports competition on or in organized training sessions.<br>
Problems of using drugs<br><br>
Peoples start using substances because of different reasons. Some
people taking substances for stimulation, some for recreational value,
and others use it because of the pressure from other people. Whatever
the reason, the effect is almost similar among all the users. When
substance users first start taking a substance, users may think they can
control how much they use. However, when time passes, they may
want more of the drug to get the same feeling or effect. Over time
some people can reaches beyond abuse to addiction. Addiction can
produce health, social, economic and cultural problems. Some of the
problems that drug users faced are:<br>
» Eat more or less than normal<br>
» Change their friends a lot<br>
» Stop taking care of themselves<br>
» Sleep at unusual hours<br>
» Lack concern in things they used to love<br>
» Have problems at work or with family<br>
» Spend more time alone than they used to<br>
» Switch quickly from feeling good to bad<br>
» Financial problems – stealing, loss of job<br>
» Strong desire to use the substance<br>
» difficulty to keep a job,<br>
» family breakdown and homelessness, tendency to avoid
friends and families,<br>
» Preferring the company of other addicts, and so they become
isolated from the society<br><br>

How people recover from drug addiction?<br>
Addictions are treatable. With the right plan and resources, recovery
is possible. The following are important steps in recovering.
Anyone who is addicted for any drug should admit to his friends, and
to himself, that he has a problem.<br>

• Find support from others.<br>
• Rewrite daily routine.<br>
• Enjoy the small successes.<br>
• Recognize and avoid relapse.<br>
• Reach freedom, and stay there<br><br>

5.8. <u>Infectious and noninfectious diseases</u><br><br>

Disease is a condition in which the body does not function normally,
and which produces symptoms such as: headache, increased body
temperature, pain, distress or feeling weak. There are two types of
diseases are called infectious and non-infectious diseases.<br><br>

5.8.1. <u>Infectious diseases</u><br><br>

Infectious diseases are diseases that are caused by disease causing
organisms. These types of diseases can be transmitted from person to
person such as HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria etc. Disease causing
organisms are organisms, which cause diseases. Examples of disease
causing organisms are bacteria, virus, protozoa, and fungi.
There are different types of infectious diseases that caused by different disease causing organisms. Their difference is based on:<br>
• the type of host that they infect, some infect human, some infect
only plant etc.<br>
• their mode of transmission, some are transmit by insects, some by
contaminated water/food etc.<br>
• type of disease causing organisms, some are caused by viruses,
some by bacteria etc.<br>
• the severity of the disease, such as the common cold, measles
and influenza, only affect us for a short period of time. Others,
such as tuberculosis (TB), human immune deficiency virus (HIV)
infection may last a much longer time.<br><br>

Transmission of infectious diseases<br>
An understanding of the biology of the pathogen and its mode of
transmission is essential to control and prevent the disease. Different
infectious diseases have different mode of transmission.<br>
• Some infectious diseases are transmitted from one per- son to
another by direct contact with a patient.<br>
• Other infectious diseases are transmit by drinking contaminated
water or by eating contaminated food, (food or water contains
disease-causing organisms like bacteria and virus). This is because
the infectious organisms can survive in water, human food, faeces<br>
• Some infectious diseases are transmitted by insect bite.<br>
• Some infectious diseases are transmitted by sexual inter-course
etc.<br><br>

Preventing infections and control methods of infectious diseases
Control is an attempt to break transmission cycles by removing the
conditions that favor the spread of the disease causing organisms.
1. Vaccination: is a major control measure for many infectious<br>
diseases; it works by making the body to defend against disease
causing organisms.<br>
2. Personal hygiene; people of all ages should wash their hands after
using the toilet and before handling or eating food; this protects
the entrance of disease causing organisms into our body.<br>
3. Hygienic food preparation: food should be covered to keep flies
away, kitchen surfaces should be cleaned to kill bacteria, and food
should be cooked exhaustively to make sure any bacteria are killed.<br>
4. Boiling cooking and/or drinking water to kill the pathogens<br> 5. Proper waste disposal: household waste should be put<br>
6. into covered bins and collected at regular intervals.<br>
7. Sewage treatment: toilet waste is a serious health threat if it is not
disposed properly. Water pipe should be arranged far from toilet
drainage. For example, the disease causing organism that cause
giardia and cholera are transmitted through contamination of
drinking water by faeces and sewage.<br><br>

Human immune deficiency virus infection/ acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV- AIDS)<br>

Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV).HIV infection rates are especially
high sub-Saharan Africa including Ethiopia. Peoples who have HIV
in their body are called HIV-positive or HIV carriers. Usually, these
HIV positive people do not show any symptom of the disease for
several years after infection. Infection of HIV starts when the virus
infects and enters to T-lymphocytes. These are cells that defend our
body from diseases.<br>
HIV replicates and survives in human T-lymphocyte cells. During its
replication HIV, destroys these T-lymphocytes cells. As a result the
number of T-lymphocytes gradually decrease which leads to declining
of disease resistant mechanism of the body. When the body reduced in
its dis- ease resistant mechanism, it causes acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is the result of opportunistic diseases like
pneumonia, TB, cancers; weight loss, diarrhoea etc.<br>
Transmission of HIV- AIDS<br>
HIV can be passed from one person to another by direct exchange of
body fluids such as:<br>
• Fluid transfer from one person to another during sexual
intercourse<br>
• Blood transfusion from one person to another, during blood
donation<br>
• Sharing needles in intravenous drug users<br>
• Mother to fetus across placenta, more often, through the mixing
of blood during birth<br>
• Mother to infant in breast milk<br>
Prevention and control of HIV-AIDS<br><br>

There are no cure drug for HIV-AIDS and no vaccine for HIV, therefore it is very important to prevent this disease by the following methods.<br>
• All blood should be tested before transfusions in activity of blood
donation<br>
• Needles used by intravenous should be sterile and used only once.<br>
• People should avoid multiple sexual activity<br>
• Using condoms, If condom is properly used, it can pre-vent the
virus transmission from carrier to healthy per-son<br>
• HIV-positive mother should be treated with appropriate retroviral
drugs. These retro-viral drugs can also significantly increase the
length of time between a person be-coming infected with HIV and
developing symptoms of AIDS and can significantly prolong life.<br><br>

Tuberculosis (TB)<br>
Tuberculosis is another example of infectious disease caused
by the bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis and rarely
byMycobacterium bovis. These bacteria live inside human cells, mainly
in the lungs. TB has many symptoms like cough, chest pain, shortness
of breath, fever, sweating, weight loss etc. After infection, some people
develop TB quite quickly, while in others the bacteria remain inactive
for many years. This difference is because of the difference in disease
resistance ability between peoples.<br><br>

TB transmission: TB bacteria can enter the lungs in airborne droplets. It spread when
infected people with the active form of the illness cough or sneeze. The
bacteria are carried in the air in tiny droplets of liquid. Transmission
occurs when people who are uninfected inhale (breath in) the
droplets. These happen rapidly in places where many people are living
in crowded conditions such as very crowded public transportation.
The other transmission way is by consuming undercooked meat and
unpasteurized milk. This type of transmission mainly occurs for the
TB transmits from infected animals.<br><br>

Prevention and control of TB<br>
There are drugs and vaccines that are important to treat and prevent
this disease<br>
Treatment of TB: A person, who shows symptoms relating to TB,
should his/her sputum sample tested for the presence of TB bacteria.
If a person is positive for TB, then patients should be isolated while they
are in the most infectious stage (which is at two to four weeks). The
treatment involves using several drugs to ensure that all the bacteria
are killed. The treatment also need about six to nine months. If the
bacteria not killed by treatment, it may be because of drug resistance
TB.<br>


Vaccine: The only vaccine available for TB is the BCG vaccine, which
is derived from animal TB bacteria and protects up to 70–80%of
people who receive it. This vaccine is given during early child or
infant stage. The effectiveness of the vaccine decreases with in old age.
TB is relating to reduced immunity of the body, increasing standards
of people who are living with HIV and treating HIV infected people
help to reduce the incidence of TB.
Avoid overcrowding; TB is a disease transmitted by inhales the bacteria
when infected person cough and sneeze therefore, good ventilation is
important to prevent this disease. Avoid eating undercooked meat and
avoid drinking unpasteurized or not boiled milk. This is important to
prevent TB transmission from animal to human.<br><br>

Malaria<br>
Malaria is caused by protozoa known as plasmodium Protozoa.
Malaria is found in many parts of the world where Anopheles mosquito
species that can act as vectors are found. It is very common in tropical
and subtropical regions where humidity is high, a comfortable
environment for mosquito breeding. Female Anopheles mosquitoes
feed on human blood to obtain the protein they need to develop their
eggs. If the person they bite is infected with Plasmodium, they will
take up some of the plasmodium together the blood meal. When
the mosquito feeds again another healthy person, she injects the
plasmodium with her saliva. Then the parasites enter the red blood
cells, where they multiply.<br>

The life cycle of Plasmodium. Plasmodium has two hosts which
are human and mosquito. The reproduction of plasmodium taken
place in both hosts, sexual reproduction in mosquito and asexual
preproduction in human .<br><br>

Prevention and control of malaria<br>
There are three main ways to control malaria:<br>
• Reducing the population of mosquitoes. This can be done by
removing sources of water in which they can breed. Sometimes,
it is possible to use Biological controls like fish which feeds on
the larva of the mosquito. In addition using insecticide to kill
mosquito is another way to reduce the number of mosquito.<br>
• Avoiding mosquitoes bite: This can be done by sleeping under a
mosquito net, or using insect repellant.<br>
• Using anti-malarial drugs such as quinine and chloroquine
to treat infected people. However, in many parts of the world
Plasmodium has evolved resistance to some of these drugs.
Chloroquine resistance is widespread in parts of South America,
Africa; newer drugs such as mefloquine are used in these areas.<br><br>

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)<br>
Corona virus large family of viruses belongs to family coronaviridae
which cause diseases in mammals and birds. This virus has extracellular
covering structure called lipid envelop. The virus also has club shaped
spikes proteins on the outer surface of the virus.
The viral envelope is made up of a lipid bilayer membrane (M),
envelope (E) and spike proteins(S). The E and M protein are the
structural proteins that combined with the lipid bilayer to shape
the viral envelope and maintain its size. S proteins are needed for
interaction with the host cells.<br>

While SARS had occurred in 2003 in China, MERS occurred in
Middle East countries in 2012. COVID-19 virus (previously called
novel coronavirus) is a new strain of a coronavirus that first emerged
in China in December1, 2019. The first case of pneumonia outbreak
was reported in Wuhan, China. On 31 December 2019, the outbreak
was traced to a novel strain of coronavirus that was given the name
SARS-COV-2 by the international committee on Taxonomy of
Viruses.SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in an animal and changed
(mutated) so it could cause illness in humans. In March 2020, the
World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a
pandemic. The disease caused by SARS-COV-2 known as coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19).<br>
Most people infected with the COVID-19 experience mild to
moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special
treatment. Older people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and
cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.<br><br>

How does the coronavirus spread?<br>
The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through the droplets and virus
particles released into the air when an infected person breathes, talks,
laughs, sings coughs or sneezes. When many people are gathered and
if there is poor ventilation, these droplets can be inhaled or land in the
mouth, nose or eyes of a person close. It can also spread, if a person
touches a surface with the virus on it and then touches his or her
mouth, nose or eyes.<br>
What are the symptoms of COVID-19<br>
COVID-19 symptoms can be very mild to severe. Even some people
have no symptoms. The most common symptoms are fever, cough,
and tiredness, shortness of breath, muscle aches, chills, sore throat,
headache, chest pain, and loss of taste or smell. This list is not all
inclusive. These symptoms may appear two to fourteen days after
exposure.<br><br>
How is COVID-19 diagnosed?<br>
COVID-19 is diagnosed or tested by taking fluid sample from nose
or mouth and testing it through a laboratory test. Laboratory testing
is important because some people with the coronavirus do not have
symptoms at all.<br>
Prevention and control of COVID-19
There are many steps you can take to prevent yourselves from getting
the COVID-19 virus and spreading it to others.<br>


Follow important precautions or instructions:<br>
• keep at least 6 feet (2 meters) of distance between<br>
• yourself and people outside your household.<br>
• avoid crowds and indoor places that have poor ventilation.<br>
• wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol based hand sanitizer that contains at least
60% alcohol.<br>
• wear a mask in public places, especially when social distancing is
difficult.<br>
• cover your mouth and nose with your elbow or a tissue when
you cough or sneeze.<br>
• Throw away the used tissue. Wash your hands rightaway.<br>
• avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth<br>
• clean and disinfect surfaces you often touch on a daily basis.<br><br>
Vaccine: currently there are different type’s vaccines produced by
different countries. Examples of these vaccines are AstraZeneca’s
AZD1222 BioNTech’s BNT162 etc. Currently, large number of people
in different country including Ethiopia receives these vaccines.<br>


If you are suspect COVID-19 or if you are ill withCOVID-19 take the
following precautions to avoid spreading the COVID-19 virus:<br>
• stay home from school and public areas, except to get medical
care.<br>
• avoid public transportation, taxis and ride-sharing if possible.<br>
• wear a face mask around other people.<br>
• isolate yourself as much as possible from others in your home.<br>
• use a separate bedroom and bathroom if possible.<br>
• avoid sharing dishes, glasses, bedding and other household
items.<br><br>


5.8.2 <u>Non-infectious diseases</u><br><br>

These are disease caused by malnutrition, chemical effect, inherited
or genetic factor etc. These diseases are not caused by disease causing
organisms. Some of the non-infectious diseases that you have learnt
previously in this chapter are:
• diseases caused by malnutrition like Kwashiorkor, Scurvy, night
blindness marasmus etc.,
• disease caused by cigarette smoke like lung cancer , Chronic
bronchitis etc.
• In addition there are other examples of sickle cell anemia, cancer,
allergies, kwashiorkor, marasmus, diabetes, podoconiosis, etc.
